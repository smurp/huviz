<BZ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Shakespeare is believed to have worked as an actor from soon after his arrival in London, still in his early twenties. He joined a company of players whose name varied with successive patrons. 28 December 1598 The Theatre in London, home of WS's acting company, was dismantled preparatory to being transported south of the river for re-erection as the Globe. From spring 1599 the company acted at the rebuilt Globe in Southwark, on the south bank of the Thames. From 1594 the company was known as the Lord Chamberlain's Men, and acted under the aegis of Lord Hunsdon (lover of the poet Aemilia Lanyer ). After about 1610 Shakespeare's company, now known as the King's Company of Players, moved their centre of operations to the private Blackfriars Theatre, which drew a wealthier class of patron. Blackfriars had been built by Richard Burbage in 1596. Apart from the composition of the audience, the biggest difference between it and the public theatres was that here candlelight could replace or supplement daylight. The company continued to act at the Globe as well." <Universal> .

<CC> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "27 November 1582 WS, aged eighteen, took out a licence to marry Anne Hathaway, who was already pregnant by him. Her name was given wrongly in the licence, which has given rise to various lines of speculation; however, there seems no good reason to doubt that Shakespeare intended from this date to marry the woman whom he did marry. Germaine Greer finds some bitter fun in tracing the progressive traducing of Anne Shakespeare by successive scholars to reach Stephen Greenblatt's belief that the prospect of sharing a grave with her filled her husband with horror and disgust. The couple had three children: a daughter, Susanna, followed by twins, Hamnet and Judith. Hamnet died young in August 1596." <Universal> .

The date is virtually a guess. The child was baptised on 26 April ; he eventually died on 23 April, which as the feast of St George, patron saint of England, is in this context a highly symbolic date. For all these reasons the attraction of 23 April as Shakespeare's Birthday has proved irresistible to tradition. The house where he was born is now a tourist site known as Shakespeare's Birthplace. He was the third child to be born and the first to survive in a family that in the end amounted to eight. Most of them lived to grow up, but only one survived longer than William." <Universal> .
