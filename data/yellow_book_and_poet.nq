She wrote to her husband that more undecorated, henceforth, my poems, the better. It is the undecorated that will live. J. L. Garvin, in the Pall Mall Gazette, humorously wished that the poems of Mrs Meynell were written by another in order that she might have been their due critic in her own prose. Only that could assure the memorable and delicate thing about them which still waits to be said. Walter de la Mare compared her to Mary Coleridge and Francis Thompson, writing that even in the earliest sonnets, with all their delicate sensitiveness, their restrained ardour, we are always conscious of a kind of native wisdom of thought that is not so much the chance and sudden flower of a happy and unforeseen moment, but that has been pondered over and proven. When Albert Cock, Professor of English Language and Literature at the then University College, Southampton, sent her his flattering review in advance of publication, she asked him to omit the personal description and tone down the ecstasies." <Universal> .

Dixon Scott wrote in the Liverpool Courier that the prose of Alice Meynell is absolutely the most perfect produced in our language for at least twenty years, maintaining that she measured up even against W. B. Yeats and Henry James. In 2011 Kate Chisholm singled out AM's passionate defence of Tetty Johnson as still the best and most inspiring essay on her." <Universal> .
<BDT> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "A Centenary Exhibition about AM was organised in London in 1947. Francis Meynell, her youngest son, published a catalogue to the exhibition the same year. Boston College also held a centenary celebration, with reminiscences by Sister Mary Madeleva, Anne Kimball Tuell, John J. Wright, and Francis Wilberforce. These were later collected and made into a short volume titled Alice Meynell: Centenary Tribute by the Rev. Terence L. Connolly, curator of the Francis Thompson Collection at Boston College. To many of her contemporaries (especially male contemporaries), AM symbolised the perfection of Woman and Mother. Many descriptions of her suggest Woolf's Mrs Ramsay in To the Lighthouse. Coventry Patmore and Francis Thompson idolised her and wrote poems about her; G. K. Chesterton proposed that the thrust of life in her was like that of a slender tree with flowers and fruit for all seasons. George Meredith referred to her as Portia and Alicia Cerulea. According to Marie Belloc Lowndes, she belonged to another, and more rarefied, sphere. Irish writer Katharine Tynan wrote, Alice Meynell bewildered me with the fulfilment of my dreams of what a poet should look like. I have an impression of Mrs Meynell\u2014she was not very strong then, and she lay on a sofa\u2014as a beautiful pale face, ivory as the crescent moon and lit by the most wonderful eyes, in masses of dark hair. I am sure there were peacocks' feathers about. Some comparisons of AM to Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Christina Rossetti have been made, though less for her poetry than for her image as a fragile, pious female poet. At the same time, however, her intellect distinguished her as a potential rival for male poets and essayists. Critic Talia Schaffer suspects a spirit of rivalry in Max Beerbohm, who had once warned that in a few years Mrs Meynell will have become a sort of substitute for the English sabbath. He ridiculed her for being matronly rather than modern and accused her of sentimental feminine behaviour, such as the adulation of children. (Schaffer traces this rivalry to the similarities between AM's style, genre, and preference for examining details of the everyday, and Beerbohm's own literary tendencies.) Novelist Phyllis Bottome (who began publishing before the first world war) articulated the oppressive aspects of the ideal represented by AM, writing each time I saw Alice Meynell I felt that I was watching a magnificent creature\u2014a tethered angel\u2014suited for enormous distances and stately freedoms, closed into a narrow space behind the iron bars of a cage." <Universal> .
<BDU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Woolf met AM in 1909 at a tea-party in Florence, Italy. She recorded her first, not entirely positive, impression: a lean, attenuated woman, who had a face like that of a transfixed hare.... This was Mrs Meynell, the writer, who somehow made one dislike the notion of women who write. Woolf's visceral reaction was also a response to the aestheticising of Meynell as the Angel in the House. Twenty years later, on reading Viola Meynell's account of her mother's life, Woolf reflected that there was some sweetness & dignity to AM. (She added: this comparing that goes on as one reads a life\u2014I kept thinking how little good could be said of me. ) AM's diligent recuperation of women's literary history nonetheless marks her as a predecessor of some of Woolf's feminist concerns. They both wrote about some of the same women, including, for example, Jonathan Swift's Stella or MD, Hester Thrale, and Wollstonecraft." <Universal> .
<BDV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "AM was twice nominated for the Poet Laureateship. The first time was in 1895 during the debate about a successor to Tennyson ; it was Patmore who nominated her and strenuously argued for her appointment. His nomination, however, amounted to little more than excitement, and Alfred Austin was appointed. Then, after Austin's death in 1913, the Daily Citizen, the Pall Mall Gazette, the Daily Mail, and the London Budget all supported AM for the position of Laureate. She and Kipling led the popular polls for successor; once again, she did not get the appointment. (No woman received it until Carol Ann Duffy in 2009.) In 1897 AM was invited by Gertrude Elizabeth Campbell (Lady Colin Campbell, journalist and divorc\u00E9e) to be President of the Society of Women Journalists, and in November 1914 she was elected to the Royal Society of Literature's Academic Committee." <Universal> .

She earned the lowly sum of fifteen to twenty pounds for each lecture, but she hoped to give enough lectures to make a bit of an income to send home to her family.

In 1852 they settled into Villa dei Franchi at Sori, where the girls were able to visit their half-sister Fanny, who lived in Genoa and to whom they were devoted. Under financial strain and general restlessness, the Thompsons migrated back and forth across the Channel several times during the years 1857-63. Describing the situation at the Thompsons' Italian villa, Dickens writes: Coming upon them unawares, I found T[hompson] with a pointed beard, smoking a great German pipe, in a pair of slippers; the two little girls very pale and faint from the climate, in a singularly untidy state\u2014one (Heaven knows why!) without stockings, and both with their little short hair cropped in a manner never before beheld, and a little bright bow stuck on the top of it." <Universal> .

<BFL> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Mother AM's mother, Christiana Weller (later Thompson), was born in 1825. A concert pianist and painter, she met her husband, then a widower, at a Liverpool Mechanics' Institute reception in 1844. They were married on 21 October 1845 in the parish church at Barnes, with Charles Dickens as witness. Christiana painted and kept a journal, which is described by Vita Sackville-West as an unconsciously vivid picture of the little family's nomadic existence in France and Italy. At Genoa, Christiana Thompson proudly exhibited her paintings for the first time. She died in 1910 at Camberley. Father AM's father was Thomas James Thompson, an illegitimate son of a British man, James Thompson, and a Creole woman, Mary Edwards. (Her ethnic roots remain unknown; it is certain she had some English blood, and the term Creole was applied to white people born in Jamaica as well as to those with mixed blood.) After his father died, Thompson's paternal grandfather brought the child and his mother back to England, where Thompson later attended Trinity College, Cambridge. Conforming to his grandfather's will, he did not pursue a profession, though he twice ran unsuccessfully for Parliament as a Liberal. He was a close friend of Dickens, with whom he had to compete (although Dickens was already married) for Christiana Weller's attention. In A Remembrance, published after her father's death, AM speaks about his life as a man of erudition and about his influence on her. After a meeting in 1882, Robert Browning noted a familial link between the Thompsons and the Barretts. Sister AM's sister Elizabeth, later Lady Butler, became a well-known painter. She earned high praise for her depiction of a battle scene in The Roll Call, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1874. The Prince of Wales offered to buy the painting but was refused by Mr Galloway, a Manchester industrialist who had already paid Elizabeth \u00A5126 for it (\u00A526 over the agreed price). Queen Victoria asked to view the painting privately at Buckingham Palace, and succeeded in pressuring Galloway to give it up. Elizabeth earned a \u00A51,200 copyright fee from the engraver.

<BFM> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "16 April 1877 Alice Thompson married Wilfrid Meynell, a journalist and editor who had converted to Catholicism at eighteen. AM's daughter-biographer Viola Meynell, however, dated her parents' wedding to the autumn 1877. Wilfrid Meynell was the seventh child of eight in a Quaker family. In 1875 he read a poem by Alice Thompson in the Pall Mall Gazette and told Father Lockhart, a friend, that she was the only woman [he] should want to marry. He was hesitant about proposing because of his meagre income, but after Alice teased him about his indifference to her, they hugged and agreed to be engaged. Wilfrid joked to friends that it was not he who had proposed." <Universal> .
<BFN> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "She bore eight children, of whom one died in infancy. As the family grew, financial worries forced her to work unceasingly. Katharine Tynan was godmother to Olivia, born in 1890, and Francis Thompson was godfather to AM's youngest child, who was born in 1891 and who later became the book designer Sir Francis Meynell. AM and the children had a post-bedtime game in which she would leave a sign that she had been to see them at the end of her working day. She was often preoccupied with dreaming up new and pleasing signs for the children, a Carlsbad plum or two black currant lozenges. Her Writer Daughter AM's fifth child was Viola Meynell. She became a poet and novelist, and published a memoir of her mother in 1929." <Universal> .

I don't like Mr Meynell one tiny scrap, and I think he's a soft-voiced Tartar and a sweet-mannered humbug. She went on to paint a picture of domestic tyranny. Mrs Meynell I find an extraordinary pathetic figure. The family never forgets it is her name that creates the family distinction, yet actually she is a mere figurehead in the establishment. Prue [Violet] told me her Mother was never consulted about anything or her wishes considered (by her Father, I'm sure she meant). Visiting again years later, after the deaths of both Alice and Wilfrid, Farjeon recorded: In the living-room stood the big table at which Alice and her seven children were once wont to sit, each writing a poem." <Universal> .

A concert pianist and painter, she met her husband, then a widower, at a Liverpool Mechanics' Institute reception in 1844. They were married on 21 October 1845 in the parish church at Barnes, with Charles Dickens as witness. Christiana painted and kept a journal, which is described by Vita Sackville-West as an unconsciously vivid picture of the little family's nomadic existence in France and Italy. At Genoa, Christiana Thompson proudly exhibited her paintings for the first time. She died in 1910 at Camberley." <Universal> .

After his father died, Thompson's paternal grandfather brought the child and his mother back to England, where Thompson later attended Trinity College, Cambridge. Conforming to his grandfather's will, he did not pursue a profession, though he twice ran unsuccessfully for Parliament as a Liberal. He was a close friend of Dickens, with whom he had to compete (although Dickens was already married) for Christiana Weller's attention. In A Remembrance, published after her father's death, AM speaks about his life as a man of erudition and about his influence on her.

<BKN> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Following her early conquest of Tennyson, AM went on to develop a large circle of literary acquaintances. Callers on the Meynells at Palace Court included Irish writer Katharine Tynan, Aubrey Beardsley (while he was still an insurance clerk), Oscar and Willie Wilde, Herbert Trench, W. B. Yeats, Hilaire Belloc and Marie Belloc Lowndes (who became exceedingly fond of AM, and enjoyed the contact with her family of children). The Meynells' social circle also included Sir Henry Taylor and Lady Taylor, Mary Shelley's daughter-in-law Lady Jane Shelley, Edmund Gosse, and later in her life, Ann Sedgwick, Phyllis Bottome, and Mother St Ignatius of Italy. In October 1898 AM visited Lady Anne Blunt (Byron's grand-daughter, who achieved some fame in her own right as a breeder of Arab horses) and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, poet, writer, and world traveller, at their home in Sussex. In 1904 she met Winston Churchill, Max Beerbohm, and Andrew Lang. At the Duke and Duchess of Connaught's home, AM encountered the Duke of Argyll. Francis Thompson April 1888 AM became acquainted with the poet Francis Thompson (no relation), a thin, nervous man, ravaged by drug-taking, over a year after he had submitted a manuscript to Wilfrid Meynell for publication in Merry England. Wilfrid Meynell recognised the genius of Thompson's writing, sought him out, and found he was dying from a laudanum addiction. Meynell sent him to a physician and took care of his attenuated finances. Thompson became a fixture in the Meynell household, coming and going with no regard for the time. He was devoted to the Meynells, especially Alice, who inspired the poetic series Love in Dian's Lap. His death (from tuberculosis on 13 November 1905, at forty-eight) affected both Wilfrid and Alice deeply, stalling Alice's creative output for several months. Coventry Patmore July 1895 AM suspended her close friendship with poet Coventry Patmore because of his increasing jealousy of her friendships with other men. They had met in 1892. Patmore told AM that he loved her more than any woman, including two former wives and his final wife. In an essay titled Distinction, he made a statement that placed her work above that of all other women writers. He made a present to her of the manuscripts of his The Unknown Eros (1877) and The Angel in the House ( 1854-62 ). When Patmore's jealousy became uncomfortable, AM distanced herself from him, after first consulting with her husband. They communicated occasionally after this, but never with ease and intimacy. She was, however, greatly affected by Patmore's death, on 26 November 1896. George Meredith AM's friendship with George Meredith did not begin until very late in Patmore's life (it was already arousing bitter jealousy in early 1896), but it lasted until Meredith's death, on 18 May 1909.

According to Marie Belloc Lowndes, she belonged to another, and more rarefied, sphere.

RMW is very much the woman fin de si\u00E8cle, she writes, nervously impressionable to the seen world and the unseen, finely touched to the magic of crowds, alert to the magnetism that is in the air of great cities, a maker of poetry whose very beauty tells us the writer is somewhat unstrung." <Universal> .

<BVP> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "In introducing The Poems of Rosamund Marriott Watson, H. B. Marriott Watson calls Tares juvenilia and suggests that the poet did not set a high value on her earliest publication. The title in itself is hardly flattering, since it alludes to Christ's New Testament parable about the wheat and tares (or weeds) sown together, requiring the precious wheat to be separated from the valueless tares. Any reservations she felt initially about the book's calibre must have been confirmed by its poor sales and scant critical notice. Tares received only a single review (a recommendation from the Academy calling it a work of the greatest promise ) and sold only twenty-three copies in three years. In late 1887 the remaining copies were sold as waste paper by her publisher, Kegan Paul." <Universal> .
<BVQ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Oscar Wilde's review of this collection for The Woman's World called RMW one of our most artistic workers in poetry. In 1902 William Archer called the collection less mature than her later volumes and observed that it contains nothing, except perhaps a few sonnets, that would claim a place in a representative selection of her best work. Despite its smallish readership, the book cemented her reputation among her contemporaries for strong verse." <Universal> .
<BVR> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Critical response was favourable. Black and White awarded RMW the very highest rank among poetesses of English birth. William Watson gave the book two favourable reviews: first in Academy on 9 January 1892 and later in the Illustrated London News on 18 June 1892, where he celebrated the author's unfailing dexterity in verse-craft. A review in the The Speaker applauded The Moor Girl's Well and A Ballad of the Were-Wolf more than the other poems, adding that the latter will never be forgotten. William Archer later singled out A South Coast Idyl as showing the wealth of colour on this painter's palette. He also maintained, however, that she had done nothing finer than On the Downs." <Universal> .

<BVT> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "RMW was clearly succeeding in the literary world, fashioning for herself a distinct poetic persona. Linda Hughes finds evidence of this in Katharine Tynan's essay A Literary Causerie, which appeared in The Speaker in late October 1892. Alongside Alice Meynell and A. Mary F. Robinson, Tynan considers Mrs Graham Tomson, and positions her as a kind of fl\u00E2neuse, a female version of the loitering fl\u00E2neur associated with French decadence. RMW is very much the woman fin de si\u00E8cle, she writes, nervously impressionable to the seen world and the unseen, finely touched to the magic of crowds, alert to the magnetism that is in the air of great cities, a maker of poetry whose very beauty tells us the writer is somewhat unstrung." <Universal> .
<BVU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Her editorial work garnered great reviews. During her tenure, the British Weekly declared Sylvia's Journal to be the most attractive of all the women's monthlies.

Tomson's editorship, the magazine is another thing." <Universal> .
<BVV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "RMW's retirement from Sylvia's Journal did not hinder her growing literary reputation. In April 1894 she was featured (as Graham R. Tomson and with a flattering photograph) alongside E. Nesbit, Christina Rossetti, Jean Ingelow, and Alice Meynell in Richard Le Gallienne's English Illustrated Magazine article Woman-Poets of the Day. He dismissed the use of the word poetess in favour of the more egalitarian poet, but faulted Tomson's work for lacking, as Hughes reports, blood and emotional vitality." <Universal> .
<BVW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "These articles probably dealt the last blow to their already strained friendship. Although they often present Hardy in a favourable light, he was less than pleased with her public account of his property dealings with the Duchy of Cornwall. A woman is at the bottom of it, of course! he wrote in a letter, I have reason to know that the writer of the account is a London lady, pretty, & well known in society (the signature is not I believe her real name). Why she should have written it I cannot say\u2014except that it was not to please me; for such gossip annoys me greatly even when true. The Dorset County Chronicle printed Hardy's rebuttal. He seems to have softened when, after her death, he wrote the poem An Old Likeness (Recalling R.T.)." <Universal> .
<BVX> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Most reviews of Vespertilia and Other Verses were extremely positive, though only one of them (by Norman Gale in Academy ) mentioned the other books published under RMW's different pseudonyms. Gale compared her to other poets of the day: While most of the women are revolting, a few of them are rhyming; and among these, in a very prominent position, we have to count Mrs. Marriott Watson. The New-York-based Independent produced these sugary comments, which read like coded references to RMW's personal transgressions: there is a smack of sophisticated honey, none the less sweet for being cleverly adulterated, in these highly colored flowers\u2014artificial flowers. It is an acquired taste, but not a bad one, by which the nectar of such honeyed words is brewed and liked. We plead guilty to a fondness for it. The hint at strange flowers here sounds like a coded reference to Baudelaire. In 1902 William Archer called Vespertilia, the poem, masterly. It ranks among those which, once read, will haunt the memory for ever." <Universal> .

ODNB says her father lived in Brussels but does not say she came from there. She was not much past thirty, but had had years of ill-health. Father Her father, born in the village of Dronrijp in Friesland, had been intended to study law, but because he was thought to be consumptive he was allowed to take up painting as a healthier occupation. After their marriage he and Pauline honeymooned in Italy and visited Pompeii at the time when the buried city was first being excavated in anything like a scientific manner. This led Lourens Alma-Tadema to execute the first of the classical paintings for which he became famous, and in the probable year of Laurense's birth he received a big commission. Later 1870 At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, LAT's father, Dutch painter Lourens Alma-Tadema, moved with his motherless children from Europe to England to settle in London, where he became known as Lawrence. He had already, the previous year, exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time. By 25 January 1873 LAT's father, painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema, received from Queen Victoria letters of denization making him a British subject. In London he became a highly successful painter and a member of the Royal Academy, known particularly for classical subjects handled with richly-coloured sensuous detail that suggested the seventeenth-century Dutch painters. After his death, however, Roger Fry lambasted the work seen in his retrospective exhibition as being all that the moderns were trying to overthrow. Alma-Tadema scholar Vern G. Swanson suggests that the creativity of both his daughters was bound up with his ebullient personality, since they were far less productive after his death. (While there may be something in this, Laurence for her part published three books after her father died, despite living in poverty and caring for her mentally unstable sister.) Sister LAT's sister, Anna, also became a painter. She first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1885 and continued to do so at the rate of a painting about every two years. She had emotional problems which were sometimes attributed to the trauma she suffered by an explosion when she was very young. In 1903 she was diagnosed as insane, though her sister Laurence, who cared for her during much of their later lives, said she was merely neurotic. Stepmother 29 July 1871 LAT's father, painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema, made a second marriage: to Laura Theresa Epps, who was not yet twenty and had been taking lessons from him. Laura Alma-Tadema was the daughter of the homoeopathic doctor George Napoleon Epps. Her sister Ellen married Edmund Gosse. Childless herself, she was a loving mother to her stepdaughters. She herself became a successful painter (exhibiting at the Royal Academy from 1873), though she never became as well-known as her husband. She died on 15 August 1909, and the Fine Art Society held a retrospective exhibition." <Universal> .

She forged friendships with other women writers, including Mona Caird, E. Nesbit, Mathilde Blind, Amy Levy, and Alice Meynell. She was also a friend of William Sharp, Austin Dobson, W. E.

She lost the companionship of her close friend Elizabeth Robbins Pennell, whose husband's commitment to Arthur Tomson kept the women apart. Her mentor Andrew Lang also severed ties. Publisher John Lane weathered the storm, remaining a committed friend and supporter until her death. The stigma resulting from this second divorce followed RMW for many years, though in 1895 Edmund Clarence Stedman (who included her in A Victorian Anthology ) dismissed the scandal in a letter to Robert Bridges, saying: Well, a woman who can write such ballads has a right to be her own mistress\u2014to touch Life, one may say, at as many points as she cares for?" <Universal> .

ODNB says her father lived in Brussels but does not say she came from there. She was not much past thirty, but had had years of ill-health." <Universal> .
<DK> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Father Her father, born in the village of Dronrijp in Friesland, had been intended to study law, but because he was thought to be consumptive he was allowed to take up painting as a healthier occupation. After their marriage he and Pauline honeymooned in Italy and visited Pompeii at the time when the buried city was first being excavated in anything like a scientific manner. This led Lourens Alma-Tadema to execute the first of the classical paintings for which he became famous, and in the probable year of Laurense's birth he received a big commission. Later 1870 At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, LAT's father, Dutch painter Lourens Alma-Tadema, moved with his motherless children from Europe to England to settle in London, where he became known as Lawrence. He had already, the previous year, exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time. By 25 January 1873 LAT's father, painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema, received from Queen Victoria letters of denization making him a British subject. In London he became a highly successful painter and a member of the Royal Academy, known particularly for classical subjects handled with richly-coloured sensuous detail that suggested the seventeenth-century Dutch painters. After his death, however, Roger Fry lambasted the work seen in his retrospective exhibition as being all that the moderns were trying to overthrow. Alma-Tadema scholar Vern G. Swanson suggests that the creativity of both his daughters was bound up with his ebullient personality, since they were far less productive after his death. (While there may be something in this, Laurence for her part published three books after her father died, despite living in poverty and caring for her mentally unstable sister.)" <Universal> .
<DL> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Sister LAT's sister, Anna, also became a painter. She first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1885 and continued to do so at the rate of a painting about every two years. She had emotional problems which were sometimes attributed to the trauma she suffered by an explosion when she was very young. In 1903 she was diagnosed as insane, though her sister Laurence, who cared for her during much of their later lives, said she was merely neurotic." <Universal> .
<DM> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Stepmother 29 July 1871 LAT's father, painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema, made a second marriage: to Laura Theresa Epps, who was not yet twenty and had been taking lessons from him. Laura Alma-Tadema was the daughter of the homoeopathic doctor George Napoleon Epps. Her sister Ellen married Edmund Gosse. Childless herself, she was a loving mother to her stepdaughters. She herself became a successful painter (exhibiting at the Royal Academy from 1873), though she never became as well-known as her husband. She died on 15 August 1909, and the Fine Art Society held a retrospective exhibition." <Universal> .

The school was one of these only recently set up by the Girls' Public Day School Company. It also took younger boys, and two of Amy's brothers attended with her. The headmistress, Edith Creak, was one of the five first graduates of the equally recent Newnham College, Cambridge. AL made some good friends at school, including Constance Black (later the translator Constance Garnett). At some time during her girlhood AL listed her favourite poets as all men, while her favourite prose writers included Charlotte Bront\u00EB, Elizabeth Gaskell, George Eliot, and Anne Thackeray Ritchie. Newnham October 1879 AL became the first Jewish woman to study at Newnham Hall (later College), Cambridge, at a time when women of any kind as undergraduates were a novel phenomenon. She was the only member of her family to attend university, even though she had four brothers. The curriculum (not yet a degree course) covered a range of subjects including Greek, Latin, geology, and gymnastics. AL had to grind hard to keep up with the work; she found the teaching excellent for everything except French. She left Cambridge in 1881 before the beginning of her third year: without, therefore, taking the Tripos exams, which had just been opened to women. She may have left for health reasons (an early attack of depression?) or have lost interest either because she was already a published author or because university-educated women were at this date regarded as a breed apart\u2014or even on account of an undocumented love-affair. Having left Cambridge, AL studied both German and Greek when she visited Dresden." <Universal> .

The Athen\u00E6um found it bright and fresh [with] a dash of originality in the idea and plenty of spirit in its execution. But having praised the central characters as a group of thorough English girls, upright, pure-minded, and headstrong, it reproves AL with positive disgust for having made a sudden wayward snatch at a foreign tar-brush. This reaction racialises a near-seduction by a socially well-placed man; the review notes that the indignation which it supposes all readers will feel at this episode is a kind of compliment to the author, and shows that she is capable of doing better. AL's recent editor, Melvyn New, thinks this a better, more substantial, and more feminist novel than Reuben Sachs ; Beckman disagrees." <Universal> .

<QA> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Jewish press was outraged by what it saw as the antisemitism of this novel. The Jewish Chronicle did not review it, but implied strong disapprobation in an article entitled Critical Jews. The Jewish Standard was somewhat more explicit (in a parody by Israel Zangwill ) and the Jewish World more outspoken still. The gentile press responded as to an expos\u00E9 of Jewish life and customs. AL's friend Eleanor Marx was deeply impressed by the book, and translated it into German the next year. After AL's death, Oscar Wilde wrote of Reuben Sachs : Its directness, its uncompromising truth, its depth of feeling, and, above all, its absence of any single superfluous word, make it, in some sort, a classic. The 2001 reprint drew a characterization of AL as a Jewish Jane Austen." <Universal> .
<QB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "After AL's premature death her writings were praised by several critics, notably Oscar Wilde. Quite apart from the biographical errors perpetrated by James Warwick Price, other myths about her were woven from her Jewishness and her suicide. Her friend Clementina Black (perhaps feeling that her reputation needed rescue) wrote that she hardly ever left her father's house. The Irish poet Katharine Tynan remembered her tragic personality and charming little Eastern face. Others have attributed to her the radical politics of some of her friends. A revival began with Melvyn New's edition in 1993 of her Complete Novels and Selected Writings. Although AL's poetry is comparatively slighted in this edition, her work has been regularly included in recent anthologies of Victorian poetry and has received serious critical attention. Cynthia Scheinberg in fact places AL's work at the centre of her feminist reconsideration of the dramatic monologue in an attempt to construct the Victorian woman poet as an agent of literary history. Critics Isobel Armstrong and Joseph Bristow place her poetry among the most important published in Britain during the 1880s. Deborah Epstein Nord considered AL's poetry and fiction alongside other members of her community of independent women, Olive Schreiner and Margaret Harkness, and found it the most direct in its treatment of singleness and urban existence, and most interesting in its representation of sexual ambiguity. In 2010 Nadia Valman and Naomi Hetherington published a volume of critical essays on AL and Christine Pullen published a biography, The Woman who Dared. Thomas Bailey Aldrich in his poem Broken Music characterizes her verse as wierdly incomplete; / Here a proud mind, self-baffled and self-stung, / Lies coiled in dark defeat. Poet Elaine Feinstein responds to her predecessor in the tribute Amy Levy in Daylight (1997)." <Universal> .

In May 1882 AL joined an unnamed club for both sexes (not the well-known Men and Women's Club ) which met twice a month, either for talk and music or for the presentation of a paper.

But a visit to the synagogue disgusted her: Zion unventilated & unrefreshed.... The place was crammed with evil-looking Hebrews. She contrasts these with some wealthy Jews she had met socially, who don't seem half bad \u2014for Jews. Her biographer Linda Hunt Beckman suggests that this insistence that Jews must be of English middle-class appearance before they could be acceptable registers a hidden self-hatred. July 1882 AL was staying at Lucerne in Switzerland. Summer 1884 AL stayed on the Titisee at Baden in Germany, where she enjoyed long basking days but was threatened with depression." <Universal> .

I am about to direct the reader's attention to... a woman of genius. Richard Le Gallienne dissented, saying: She puts too much into a sentence. The words have no room to breathe in." <Universal> .

It found her able to do what few but the best thinkers can do, to start upon a common subject at a new point and to maintain an untrammelled line right to the end. AM considered with some amusement that the reviewer had blundered in aligning her with Pater : she considered herself the only literary person now alive who has never read Pater at all." <Universal> .

Garvin, in the Pall Mall Gazette, humorously wished that the poems of Mrs Meynell were written by another in order that she might have been their due critic in her own prose. Only that could assure the memorable and delicate thing about them which still waits to be said. Walter de la Mare compared her to Mary Coleridge and Francis Thompson, writing that even in the earliest sonnets, with all their delicate sensitiveness, their restrained ardour, we are always conscious of a kind of native wisdom of thought that is not so much the chance and sudden flower of a happy and unforeseen moment, but that has been pondered over and proven. When Albert Cock, Professor of English Language and Literature at the then University College, Southampton, sent her his flattering review in advance of publication, she asked him to omit the personal description and tone down the ecstasies." <Universal> .

She then wrote in her diary: Of all the crying evils in this depraved earth... the greatest... is the miserable selfishness of men that keeps women from work.... work of the mind as well as of the body. She supported women's suffrage, as well as other social reform movements, and became the president or vice-president of various suffrage societies. She admired Charlotte Despard, but did not approve of militancy. She also supported married women's right to work and the reform of marriage laws. On the subject of suffrage, AM mockingly comments, the characteristics of men, that, at least, is the phrase which women will use when they acquire the way, so wonderful in men, in writing of the other half of the race as an accident and a subject of accidental study. She softens this by adding, [h]umanity could ill spare them\u2014woman's best companions. She then, however, goes on to scoff at the habit by which some men reproach a silly woman through her sex, whereas a silly man is not reproached through his." <Universal> .
