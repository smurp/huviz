She repeatedly found herself unfitted to the jobs she had taken on, and therefore shifted from one employment to another. But the chance to work must be seen as positive. About September 1915 RM began six months as a VAD at a military convalescent hospital at Mount Blow, near Great Shelford ; she found it very stressful. World War I Women's Employment This was conveniently near her parents' home; but she turned out to be completely unsuited for the work. February 1916 RM began working on a farm near Great Shelford as a land-girl or member of what was soon to be called the Women's Land Army, a job more congenial to her than VAD nursing. World War I Women's Employment This involved herding sheep and preparing the still half-frozen fields for spring planting. She was paid threepence an hour. Early 1917 RM began a year working in London as a junior administrative clerk in the Exemptions Bureau of the Ministry of War. World War I Women's Employment She often worked ten-hour days. This, combined with three or more hours of commuting time every day (from the family home, which since her father's death was in Beaconsfield ), kept her spare time to a minimum. She did, however, sometimes visit friends at weekends. A year after taking this job she was transferred from the War Office to the Ministry of Information, where she worked as a wartime bureaucrat. She was then, because of her fluent Italian, posted to the Department for Propaganda in Enemy Countries, occupying Crewe House in London. World War I Women's Employment politics Late 1918 After the war, RM went to work as a reader of fiction for the Constable publishing house, who shortly afterwards published her books What Not and Three Days.

She and her siblings did Latin, Italian, and mathematics with their father, and other subjects, including religion, with their mother.

<BFJ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "April 1892 RM and two of her sisters began attending classes as day pupils, taught by the nuns in a Varazze convent school. They attended for six months, but cultural differences made it an unhappy experience for them. Autumn 1894 RM and two of her sisters began attending Oxford High School for Girls. The headmistress, Lucy Soulsby, attempted to instil true religion, good manners, and sound learning, in that order. In spite of providing a model of an educated woman able to hold her own alongside educated men, she was averse to the granting of university degrees to women, feeling that the role of both married and unmarried women was to mother men as well as children. She believed women should work through and with men, not separately or against them. RM adopted a strategy of silence at school and became socially shy, expressing her more individualistic visions only after school hours and among her family. 29 July 1899 RM left Oxford High School for Girls shortly before she was eighteen, having taken the external Oxford and Cambridge Higher Certificate Local Examination. She satisfied the requirements in French, German, and Elementary Mathematics and was awarded a Distinction in History. Autumn 1900 RM's godfather, Reginald Heber Macaulay ( Uncle Regi ), paid for her to enter Somerville College, Oxford, to read Modern History. She did not sit for her final exams in 1903, either because of nervous collapse associated with her hatred for the examining, classifying system, or of some other illness. She was awarded an Aegrotat (an unclassed degree allowed in case of illness) instead, but it is not clear whether the decision to withdraw from the exams and apply for an aegrotat instead was or was not her own idea. Somerville's policy of encouraging strong individualism had facilitated her development and nurtured her critical abilities. But when in 1920 degrees and university membership were eventually awarded to women (retroactively to those who had met the requirements), RM decided not to collect a degree. Education" <Universal> .

She longed for sons, and was very disappointed that her first three children were girls. She was delighted when she had two sons before having two more daughters.

When Grace Macaulay died at sixty-nine, RM felt guilty about all her years of being impatient with and critical of her mother's emotional pettiness and prejudices. Father RM's father, George Campbell Macaulay, was a schoolmaster at Rugby School when she was born. He later became an academic. His death at sixty-three in 1915 was both a great loss and a great shock for RM, who had been devoted to him all her life. 15 September 1887 RM's father left Rugby School to take his family to live in the warm climate of Varazze, Italy, on account of his wife's ill health. They stayed in Italy for seven years. While there he did free-lance translations and edited school texts to support his family. In August 1894 he moved the family back to England, to live in Oxford, where he did literary research in the Bodleian Library with his sights set on entering the literary-academic mainstream. His discovery of a previously unknown manuscript by John Gower, which he edited, enabled this dream to become a reality..

<BMU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "However, as biographer Constance Babington Smith notes, she continued into her seventies to indulge in many of the activities of her youth, and not only swam as often as possible but bicycled and went for long walks, rowed (gently) when occasion offered, and even, when in lonely and unobserved country, climbed trees. She loved speed. She owned a car, and loved to drive fast (she was once convicted of careless driving after a car crash in which Gerald O'Donovan suffered head injuries), and she had always wanted to fly. That dream became a reality in January 1932 when she and two of her sisters took a joyride from an aerodrome near London. RM loved it so much that she went up again a few years later with her friend Hamish Hamilton, a publisher and an enthusiastic pilot. He let her take over the controls for a while.

In 1953 she revisited Greece (where she had been forty years before) on a tour which also included Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, and the coast of Asia Minor. Ireland A friend invited RM to visit his home in Northern Ireland in 1912. In her later life she made two pilgrimages to Ireland itself: she revisited scenes of Gerald O'Donovan's youth and her own while researching ruins in 1949, for The World My Wilderness. The United States December 1929-January 1930 RM and her sister Margaret landed in New York and travelled by train to Portland, Oregon, to meet their brother Will; then the three drove down the West Coast towards Mexico. They were not permitted entry. Mexico had only just achieved fairly stable status as a constitutional democracy in which the Catholic Church no longer wielded overwhelming power. The Mexican border guards took Margaret's Deaconess's uniform to be the habit of a Catholic nun. religion Transportation Sicily, Portugal, Spain RM went on a two-week tour of Sicily with friends in 1931. She spent several months researching in Portugal in 1943, visiting Lisbon and Oporto. In Portugal she visited the one of Marie Belloc Lowndes's married daughters who lived there, and contacted Lowndes on her return to report on the children whom their grandmother had never seen. Travelling along the Mediterranean coast of Spain for the sake of research, she swam in the sea at every opportunity, and negotiated nearly impassable roads and mule tracks in a difficult old car. She returned to the area with friends for a month's holiday a year later. Trebizond June 1954 RM visited Turkey alone, and was fascinated by the ancient city of Trebizond. August 1958 A final adventurous Hellenic voyage was the last of RM's travels, in the year of her death. This cruise took in Russia, the Crimea, Georgia, the Caucasus, Trebizond (which RM had by now used in the title of a book), the Aegean Islands, and Venice." <Universal> .

<BOK> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "RM had many close friends over the course of her life, and many of them left their own mark on literary or cultural history. Naomi Royde-Smith In 1921 RM was spending several nights a week in a room she rented in the large house of writer Naomi Royde-Smith at 44 Prince's Gardens, Kensington. Chosen by Royde-Smith as a prot\u00E9g\u00E9e, she was often the centre of attention at her friend's very successful weekly Thursday evening salons. Those attending were both literary neophytes and leading writers, including Mary Agnes Hamilton, Storm Jameson, Virginia Woolf, Elizabeth Bowen (whose career RM was able materially to forward by introducing her to Royde-Smith), Edith Sitwell, Walter de la Mare, and Aldous Huxley. The guests differed among themselves as to whether these salons were attended chiefly by the creative, the unadventurous, or the mediocre. Vera Brittain was another young writer to whom Bowen was helpful, but the friendship between them did not endure. Royde-Smith, too, made problems over RM's liaison with Gerald O'Donovan (apparently being indiscreet about it), and this caused a rift in their friendship. Storm Jameson later wrote that Macaulay was kind on my first evening, and I had no fear of her, nor of her salty tongue. She was enchanting to watch, a narrow head covered with small curls, like a Greek head in a museum, with that way she had of speaking in arpeggios, and the lively hands, the small arched nose and pale deep-set eyes. Bloomsbury Group; Friday Hampstead Circle Mid 1920s After her rift with Naomi Royde-Smith, RM began associating more with the Bloomsbury group and with the Friday Hampstead Circle. She had a common interest with members of the Bloomsbury group in anti-authoritarianism, liberalism, and libertarianism, along with a hatred of cruelty and respect for reason. However, she was not as interested as other members of the group in the structural aesthetics of the novel or of other art-forms. RM also regularly attended the gatherings of the Friday Hampstead Circle, presided over by Dorothy and Reeve Brooke and later by Sylvia and Robert Lynd. These gatherings were attended by RM's friends Ivy Compton-Burnett and Victor Gollancz, and visited by Max Beerbohm and James Joyce. She was later a frequent visitor at the country retreat of Victor Gollancz and his wife Ruth, who designed her a bookplate Virginia Woolf When RM met Virginia Woolf, their relationship was slow to develop, because of her nervousness among the intellectual aristocrats of Bloomsbury. However, they remained friends until Woolf's death, and RM's friendships with others in the group survived that blow. Ronald Ross, Rupert Brooke RM's friendship with Ronald Ross survived his family's suspicions after they had first met that she was fortune-hunting. Later she was friendly with both him and his wife. Rupert Brooke was initially a family friend (six years younger) of RM. The independent friendship they established lasted until his death in the First World War. Of Macaulay's biographers, Emery suggests she may have felt an unrequited love for the romantically handsome Brooke, while LeFanu traces some unexplained parallels in their poetry. Ivy Compton-Burnett 25 July 1929 RM met Ivy Compton-Burnett ; they immediately became true and intimate friends, and the friendship lasted for life. Gilbert Murray Through correspondence RM became a life-long friend of Gilbert Murray, Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford, and Chairman of the Executive of the League of Nations Union. He was fifteen years her senior, but they shared interests and activities, including classical studies, international peace-making, Liberal politics, and their various performances on the BBC." <Universal> .
<BOL> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Hamilton Johnson had been RM's interim confessor at St Edward's House, Westminster, from 1912 to 1916. After one of their interviews he joined the Cowley Fathers community in Boston. The two maintained a correspondence for eight years, until RM's death. She considered Johnson both a spiritual advisor and a friend. Although he was initially a mentor, Johnson felt that their exchanges of ideas was as educational for him as for her. When people close to her found her changed in the last two years of her life, RM explained that an empty God hole in her life had been filled at last." <Universal> .

<BSU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "In a 1934 letter to Frank Swinnerton RM called this work that absurd juvenile, and (I hope) forgotten book. The novel was very well received by reviewers. However, RM found it difficult to accept such praise. In a letter to a friend from her Somerville days she wrote: The reviews amuse me immensely.... Altogether the whole business is beyond words funny; if you want to be really interested and entertained publish a novel; it's quite worth it! Lucy Soulsby, RM's former headmistress at Oxford High School for Girls, wrote enthustiastically to Macaulay's publisher, John Murray: I believe you have hit on a new writer which I very seldom think when I read young women's novels!!

<BSW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "To celebrate the appearance of her collection, RM threw a party at her flat to which she ambitiously invited Walter de la Mare. He attended, as did her publisher for this book, Frank Sidgwick. Also there were Rupert Brooke and Naomi Royde-Smith. Edward Thomas, reviewing The Two Blind Countries for The Bookman, compared her poetry to de la Mare's. Most of her poems, he said are decidedly more intellectual and less sensuous than Mr. de la Mare's best work." <Universal> .
<BSX> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The volume was much praised. The Athen\u00E6um called RM one of the most interesting of contemporary poets and a very accomplished metrist. A few years later, however, Humbert Wolfe wrote of her poetry that those who like it best have always been aware of something held back, some quality in reserve, and Walter de la Mare thought her poems showed that she was primarily a novelist. Mary Agnes Hamilton, writing during the second world war, said that this slim volume contained more than Macaulay's novels of the Rose I know and love, since in them the deep underlying seriousness that gives special searching tang to her wit escapes from the thicket of delightful nonsense in which it generally plays hide and seek." <Universal> .

<BSZ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "RM was awarded the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize for this novel in the year after its publication. In a sardonic review of her own novel, she said it aimed at investigating the psychology of different ages ranging from twenty to eighty-four. She also called it ordinary and possessed of a rather glib facility of thought and method. Thirty years later she felt it was rather poor, on the whole, and regrettably lacking in humour." <Universal> .

<BTB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The book did well in Britain (the Times Literary Supplement called it in many respects a brilliant piece of work ), but it sank with scarcely a ripple in the USA.

John Connell of the Evening News said: It is exquisitely comic, deeply serious, sad, and challenging. The younger writer Pamela Frankau called it her favourite novel in ten years. At her first reading she had supposed that Laurie was a man, and therefore that the novel gave a most adult, truthful and nonchalant approach to a homosexual love affair. On finding she was mistaken, and re-reading, she still felt that RM had carefully concealed Laurie's gender, planting only four clues. The Towers of Trebizond is still generally ranked as one of RM's finest works." <Universal> .

She had declined the offer of a CBE in the late thirties, feeling that accepting one would oblige her to support the Establishment. When she was offered the award of DBE in 1958, she requested that it be made a CBE instead: she was embarrassed and did not want to outdo her sister's 1956 CBE. The request was refused. RM was finally persuaded to accept the honour in order to increase the low number of literary Dames. The Times obituary noted her novels' continued power to enchant, but stressed particularly her personal appeal. Few writers this century inspired so quick and so lasting an affection among people of every kind. Her most recent biographer, Sarah Lefanu, finds it curious that a writer so prolific, popular in her lifetime, important, and influential should have been so systematically marginalised by literary and cultural critics. She suspects that Macaulay's many shifts in position, her non-membership of groups, may have contributed to this situation." <Universal> .

<BWT> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The WSPU ES describes her suffrage involvement as springing directly from her social conscience. From childhood she had observed the evidence of abuses in society ( ragged and barefoot children begging in the streets, the desperate poverty of agricultural labourers and urban sweated workers). After some spasmodic excursions into philanthropy, the appearence of the militant suffragists caused her to realise the political futility of the voteless reformer. Autumn 1906 ES committed herself to the suffragist cause by joining the WSPU, after being sent by the Manchester Guardian to cover the annual conference of the National Union of Women Workers at Tunbridge Wells. The Union had been founded in August 1874. This year's annual conference coincided with a court appearance of Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Annie Cobden-Sanderson, and others (following their arrest on 23 October), and was therefore packed with the press. ES made the realization that freedom, directly you discover you haven't got it, will not wait another minute. Listening to novelist and actress Elizabeth Robins, a recent convert to the cause, delivering her first-ever suffrage speech had what Sharp later called a disastrous effect on her, alter[ing] the whole course of [her] life, and ensuring that for at least twelve years she never again knew what it was to cease from mental strife. Within three months she was making her own maiden speech at Fulham Town Hall, to a hostile audience. For five years her suffragist activities were limited in one direction by an undertaking she gave her mother not to risk imprisonment. In November 1911 her mother wrote a warm and touching letter to absolve her of her promise. ES says that in years of addressing every kind of indoor and outdoor audience all across Britain, she became inured to insults and missiles (chestnuts, rotten eggs, live mice) but never lost her distaste for the platform or her cold feeling at the pit of the stomach. Later, from 1910 to 1913, she was secretary of the Kensington branch of the WSPU. She was present (as reported by Violet Hunt ) at the suffrage meeting in the Albert Hall in early December 1908, where Lloyd George addressed an audience of Liberal women including suffragettes wearing prison uniform as a reminder of the punishment they were courting. She was one of those violently ejected from this meeting, which was marred by violence from both sides. January 1909 ES arrived at Esbjerg in Denmark, in which country she was to lecture on behalf of the WSPU about the suffrage movement in England. A leading Danish paper reported after her first lecture that she was not at all like a wild cat. After 21 November 1911 ES was sent to Holloway in London for two weeks for breaking government-office windows in a suffrage demonstration: It pleases me still to remember that the War Office fell to my pacifist hand. Politics" <Universal> .
<BWU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "She later wrote that she was less able to endure her two weeks in prison with equanimity than were most of the more than three hundred suffragists arrested with her. She was instrumental in enabling Christabel Pankhurst to escape to Paris when detectives came to arrest her, with the Pethick-Lawrences, in March 1912, but later in the year, with her loyalties painfully divided, she left the WSPU when Christabel split with Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence over increased use of violence. August 1913 ES spent a night in a police-station cell en route for another sojourn in Holloway, having been arrested along with Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and Lady Sybil Smith outside the House of Commons. In the police cell she realised how terrible were the conditions endured by the dreary procession of derelict men and women... some drunk, some obviously only starved and dazed. Police cells had not improved in the way that prison itself had improved since becoming full of protesting middle-class women." <Universal> .
<BWV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The United Suffragists February 1914 ES was one of the founders and committee-members of the United Suffragists (who were crucial in actually securing the vote), for which she became official as well as de facto editor of Votes for Women. The United Suffragists set out to be inclusive and to welcome members of both sexes. It had to operate within a difficult climate caused by the recent splits among the suffrage movement. From later this year ES became more and more of a pacifist as the war progressed. She believed that the enfranchisement of women involved greater issues than could be involved in any war. When women got the vote in 1918, friends of ES gave a dinner and made a presentation in honour of her striving in the cause. Later, however, during the 1930s, she was perturbed by the direction that feminism was taking, towards emphasising inborn differences between the sexes. She preferred the old feminism, with its emphasis on equal humanity and equal rights." <Universal> .
<BWW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "As the Great War rolled on ES found herself more and more of a pacifist. During her very few holidays from writing and from trying to keep the suffrage cause alive, she took jobs on the land. She visited the hospital being run at Wimereux near Boulogne by two women doctors, Louisa Garrett Anderson and Flora Murray (who had overcome the prejudice of the British War Office against them by working first with the unprejudiced French Red Cross ). At home ES let her largest room to a war worker. With the United Suffragists she ran a club in Southwark to lighten the lives of women and girls living without their men. In autumn 1914 she took some part in organizing the Women's International Peace Congress that took place at The Hague the following year, and had therefore the satisfaction of having helped towards the founding of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. As a former militant she was refused permission by the Home Office to travel to the Hague to attend the Women's International Congress. (In the end Britain allowed no woman to travel to the conference; its only representatives were three who were already abroad.) Another of her significant political actions was refusing to pay her taxes on the principle of no taxation without representation; she felt that the penalties levied on her for this were political too." <Universal> .
<BWX> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Early 1918 ES joined the Labour Party shortly after women won the vote. She was several times invited to stand for election to parliament, but replied that she did not think herself well suited to the necessary compromises of parliamentary politics. She later wrote that she would have joined the British Communist Party but for its approval of armed force as a means of achieving revolution." <Universal> .
<BWY> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The reason for her fact-finding visit in 1921 was that ES had been asked to be a speaker in a campaign to raise awareness in Britain about the Irish situation, and she felt that she could not speak of what she had not seen. Looking back at the course of Irish politics in 1919, she felt that in 1903 a peaceful settlement might have been achieved in Ireland. By the time of her second visit, she felt that hatred of the oppressor had reached a crucial stage (pressed by the blunders of a policy of suppression following the Easter Rising of 1916) and that the Gaelic revival was merged in Sinn Fein. In 1921 she was consumed with distress at the barbaric stupidities and cruelties I saw perpetrated by the Black and Tans and the Auxiliary Division, and concluded that the British terror had failed to frighten a single rebel or relative of a rebel into submission, and it certainly created more rebels by the score, while paralysing the existing forces of law. She mentions how her poor sense of direction caused her, in Cork, to run into a band of Black and Tans she was trying to avoid ( she had an incriminating list of names hidden in her shoe ), but her inoffensive appearance saved her. But what smashed her up worse than physical danger, worse than the overwork of recent years, was the cumulative shame of being an Englishwoman, with Ireland in its present condition. In August 1921, on her second visit that year, ES witnessed a change in that condition with the aftermath of the July truce, and attended the earliest Dail Eireann meetings." <Universal> .
<BWZ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Germany ES attended the second congress of the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace, which was held at Zurich on 12-17 May 1919 (and which gave the organization its lasting name of Women's International League for Peace and Freedom ). Believing that the Treaty of Versailles had made the world safe for dictators, she was outraged that the blockade of Germany was continued for seven months after the end of the war. (In Berlin in 1920 she heard a friend remark on the absence of babies: because so many had died for want of milk or through the starvation of their mothers. ) She joined the Fight the Famine Council, which opposed the blockade (and which in May 1919 gave birth to the charity Save the Children ), and through them became involved with the relief work carried out by the Society of Friends. She volunteered for work in Poland, but after meeting difficulties in getting a passport (her militant past again) she eventually worked not there but in Berlin. She found considerable anti-French feeling and an occasional anti-Jewish cry, but little trace of militarism. Most of the students and others whom the Quakers were helping were anti-militarist. Looking back from 1933 when she wrote her memoirs, ES then lamented the later loss of the spirit of idealism she had known among the starving Germans of 1920, when the Weimar Republic was attempting in terrible circumstances to set up a welfare state." <Universal> .

<BXA> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "On her first 1923 visit she found German nationalism already much stronger than before, but mostly among the property-owning classes dispossessed by the war. The later, fervent working-class nationalism had not begun, and ES was astonished that the working class was not more anti-French than it was. She met members of a Socialist youth movement whom she admired. She found her second visit nightmarish, and the recently formed Separatist groups in the French-occupied Rhineland (occupied for the purpose of collecting war reparations) reminded her of the Black and Tans in Ireland. She found it hard to get a visa for this journey, since the passport officials had decreed that the area was too dangerous for a woman. In fact she found the English very popular in Cologne, where a crowd of special correspondents had gathered to cover the disturbances. But she reported harrowingly on violence and on want (people dropping dead in queues for potatoes in Essen ) as well as on inflation (a tram to M\u00FClheim cost 6 milliards one day, 13 milliards the next, and 18 milliards for the return journey an hour later). In 1931 ES was alarmed by the economic situation (which, after a glimmer of prosperity, threatened to plunge Germany back into deprivation) but much more by the rise of Hitler ism and the young storm-troops parading with shouted anti-semitic songs. She was encouraged only by the efforts being made in the schools, and by the fact that the working class seemed neither so nationalistic nor so despairing as the middle and upper classes. Russia ES was thoroughly in sympathy with the principles of the Russian Revolution, and was one of the founders of the British 1917 Club. She noted that the concept of equal sharing at the root of Communism was the same as that practised by the early Christians. Yet when the British Communist Party check was founded in 1920 she did not join: its militarism and the idea of dictatorship by the proletariat did not appeal to her." <Universal> .
<BXB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "In Communist Russia ES was interested to find religion still being practised. She and Ruth Fry met the Minister of Education and were told that 11,000 new schools had been built and more were needed, to cope not only with children but with the adult, even aged, illiterates who were thronging to learn to read and write. They visited schools, children's homes, and welfare centres, and received sharply contradictory accounts of the Cheka, which according to the pacifist Tolstoyan Chertkov had shot dozens of pacifists for refusing military service. With her usual attention to the part played by gender, ES was pleased at the equitable distribution of power at a farm school where the director of studies was a woman, and of the household a man." <Universal> .

<BZB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "ES had arranged before leaving home for London for a single pupil, whom she was to teach every day. (She had already been teaching village lads in Buckinghamshire.) She was soon lecturing in London schools as well as coaching private pupils, and writing in the evening by candlelight after the gas was turned off at 11 p.m. Her writing career became gradually better and better established. After a year's absence from London and from earning, to live with her mother after her father's death, she decided not to start again from scratch building a teaching connection, but to work as a journalist instead." <Universal> .
<BZC> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "ES was apparently an unusually effective public speaker. Henry Nevinson, her long-time lover and eventual husband, said she was driven to speech by a white-hot indignation that blazed in her words rather than in outward gesture or visible emotion, and that her power (beyond that of any other suffrage speaker) to capture an audience lay in her strange combination of humour and pathos combined. Sylvia Pankhurst called her one of those frail wan-faced little people who look as if a puff of wind would blow them away but manage to accomplish such quantities of work as fill the strongest with amaze, while still retaining the brightest and cheeriest good humour." <Universal> .
<BZD> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "May-August 1920 ES worked at the Quaker headquarters in postwar Berlin. She had originally intended to join in Quaker efforts to limit the spread of typhus in Poland (by de-lousing refugees), but her travel there was blocked by British authoriities. She helped set up cheap Quaker-run restaurants for students (which allowed them to go on with their studies, as they could not otherwise have done), acted as a receptionist at the Society's headquarters, lectured about England at Berlin University, and visited (but did not work at) feeding centres for schoolchildren." <Universal> .
<BZE> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "At the end of her first day in Buzuluk ES felt that a corpse lying face down in the snow was the happiest thing she had seen all day. Within only a few days she and her companions ascertained that famine conditions were at least as bad as reports suggested, almost unimaginably bad. As the party dispersed, some to nurse other Quaker relief workers through typhus and others back to England to spearhead a publicity campaign, ES found herself in virtually sole charge of the mission in a small provincial town where a hundred people a day were dying of starvation in shelters or in the streets, where burials could not keep up with deaths, and where, quite reasonably, the decision had been taken that only a small proportion of the population, mostly children, could be saved. She later wrote that she had never in my life felt less able to deal with a situation. She had to provide food (mostly tinned) and first aid for a handful of relief workers, sleigh drivers, and other staff, doing domestic work in the mornings and in the afternoons visiting clearing-houses for the children taken in from the streets who would indeed be fed and saved." <Universal> .
<BZF> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "From 1927 ES worked with the Advisory Committee on Juvenile Employment \u2014which, she said, kept her remembering the room for improvement in the nation's treatment of the mass of its children. She had already belonged for a while to another organization called Kibbo Kift, which had been founded with the aim of bringing together people of both sexes and of different ages and classes in manner similar to that of the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides, with a similar emphasis on outdoor life and ceremonials, but without the Scouts' military or imperial associations. In 1929, feeling short of money, ES investigated several paid jobs to supplement her journalism. She worked for a while as a publisher's reader for Victor Gollancz." <Universal> .

At the same time she imbibed from her brothers the idea that girls are intrinsically lacking in both courage and a sense of honour. One of her early books was Maria Callcott's Little Arthur's History of England, and she had an infatuation for Hans Christian Andersen. (Her favourite story was The Ugly Duckling.) Her father also read to her in the evenings from Boswell's Life of Johnson, and a day trip one summer to Lichfield, Johnson's birthplace, was a great day for her." <Universal> .
<CBV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "At about the age of twelve she began as a day-girl at Miss Spark's school, Strathallan House, in Bolton Gardens, South Kensington. She became a full boarder at just fifteen when her family moved to Weston Turville, a village in Buckinghamshire. At this school, where she had lessons in French, German and arithmetic, she also felt with exhilaration and liberation on becoming a boarder that she had gone right away from home, out of a circle whose standards I could now exchange for others that I found far easier to appreciate. At school she first began to find myself and to discover I was not the stupid person I often felt at home. She also understood for the first time that girls were not the inferior species that her brothers maintained. Her three years at the school (which was advanced for its day) were happy ones, and her four terms as a boarder were deeply influential.

She continued, however, to pursue scholarly interests: reading, passing University local examinations, dabbling in botany geology and entomology, and passing on what I learned to village lads of my own age in evening classes that I started for them." <Universal> .

<CCT> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Beverly Lyon Clark, who wrote an introduction to this book and thought extremely highly of it, argued that the neglect of it stemmed from its belonging not just to one but to several under-appreciated genres, as a children's book and as a girls' school story. Clark situates this book in a tradition of school stories whose protagonists learn to exercise virtue not in the public world, like the boy heroes of Thomas Hughes or Rudyard Kipling, but in the world of home, like the girl protagonists of Sarah Fielding's The Governess, Mary Wollstonecraft's Original Stories from Real Life, Charles and Mary Lamb's Mrs Leicester's School, or Harriet Martineau's The Crofton Boys. She was bold enough to suggest that The Making of a School Girl is better (because less preachy, sentimental, or condescending) than Louisa May Alcott's Little Women or Frances Hodgson's The Secret Garden." <Universal> .
<CCU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The London Child was well reviewed. The Nation called it a delight to anyone who cares about children and the Bookman wished that a copy might be distributed to every London rate-payer. Recent editor Beverly Lyon Clark faulted it for condescension towards working-class parents and children, and judged the best parts of the book to be ES's handling of her own experiences and of children's imaginings. The Child Grows Up had parallel success with reviewers, parallel failure to sell: both were, said ES, good for her reputation but bad for her pocket." <Universal> .
<CCV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "An unfriendly notice in Punch complained that this novel was somewhat embarrassing to a reviewer, for it has the theme of a great book with the manner of a trivial one. The reviewer called Sharp's utopian society the nice ideal behind many nasty manifestations in the real world, and concluded by doubting whether her method was truly the best way of advocating her common cause \u2014a phrase which links her pejoratively to the suffrage paper The Common Cause. Henry Nevinson, however, judged this to be Sharp's greatest book, worthy of comparison with Swift's Gulliver's Travels or Samuel Butler's Erewhon. Harold Laski, too, admired it." <Universal> .
<CCW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "ES was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. She was already almost entirely forgotten by the time of her death, perhaps because so much of her writing was done for children, while her important voice in the struggles for women's suffrage and for peace had found their expression mostly in ephemeral speeches and journalism. She has (in 2010) no entry in either the Dictionary of Literary Biography or Contemporary Authors. In scholarly journals, however, a revival of interest seems at last to be under way, fuelled by Angela John's biography, which gives detailed and highly rewarding attention to ES's writings, including her journalism.

This mixed heritage was said to account for the musical talent in the family. Her mother seemed to Evelyn to be blessed with eternal youth, and was nearly ninety when she died in February 1915. Evelyn ascribes to the large size of the family the fact that she never learned to make a real friend of my mother until she was quite old and I was nearing middle age. A turning point came when her mother, who had made the militant suffragist Evelyn promise not to do anything that might get her sent to prison, wrote to withdraw her bid to control her daughter, recognising the unhappiness her stand had caused to both of them, and encouraging Evelyn, in a proof of rare understanding, to go her own way and be happy in it. Jane Bloyd Sharp died in February 1915. Father ES's father, slate merchant James Sharp, was a businessman by inheritance and necessity (who as the only surviving brother had taken control of the family firm when he was only sixteen), but an intellectual by taste and temperament.

They declined Ramsay MacDonald's offer to be best man, not wanting the publicity. They were now constant companions, having belonged long ago to the same walking club and to the United Suffragists, and having worked together at many sites of political activism both in England and abroad (though their published accounts of this work had minimised their collaboration and companionship). Nevinson was one of the friends who had broken past the gatekeeper to embrace Sharp on her release from Holloway Prison in 1911, had come to say goodbye to her in Berkshire before setting out for Germany as a war correspondent in 1914, and had been in Whitehall with her and Bertha Brewster on the evening of 6 February 1918 when the Representation of the People (or Reform) Act received the royal assent and British women (if over thirty and rate-paying) were enfranchised. His first wife, Margaret Wynne Nevinson, had been a suffragist, educationist, and writer. Henry Nevinson had not for years been in love with his wife, though he was for years in love with a different mistress. The relationship between him and Sharp had been, over the years, complicated by these factors. The couple were married on the day that ES completed her autobiography, after a month's engagement. This was six months after Margaret Nevinson died of kidney failure, and Sharp had to tread carefully in her relationship with Margaret's children. Among much other writing Henry Nevinson published two books of memoirs, More Changes, More Chances, 1925, and the posthumous Visions and Memories, 1945, edited by ES." <Universal> .

With the oldest of all her friends from childhood, Euterpe Craies, her support for militant suffragism made for a tense few years, but the friendship endured. Through having her first story accepted by The Yellow Book and her first novel by the Bodley Head, ES became friendly with Henry Harland (editor of The Yellow Book ) and his wife Aline (with whom she also travelled abroad), and with John Lane (at the Bodley Head). Both the Harlands and Lane entertained regularly: Lane at tea parties in The Albany and the Harlands on Saturday evenings at 144 Cromwell Road. ES became a regular at both, and made the acquaintance of Henry James, Aubrey Beardsley, Max Beerbohm, Kenneth Grahame (who became a close friend, and according to Henry Nevinson would have liked to marry her), W. J. Locke (whose friendship, she says, she lost on account of her suffrage activities), Mabel Dearmer (who became her illustrator), Laurence Housman, Ella D'Arcy, and Netta Syrett. She also met (on a single occasion only) Oscar Wilde, and (on a different occasion) the explorer Mary Kingsley. Others with whom she shared this or that memorable experience were the Meynells ( Wilfrid, Alice, and Viola ), Clarence Rook and his wife, and Henry W. Nevinson, whom she eventually married. At Aldeburgh in Suffolk in 1905 for a commemoration of George Crabbe, ES met Dora Sigerson and her husband Clement Shorter, and also Thomas Hardy, for whom her admiration and friendship developed further when he showed her around his native Dorchester. She became a good friend of Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson, stayed with Elizabeth Garrett Anderson in Scotland, and through them met Millicent Fawcett. With Elizabeth Robins she enjoyed the kind of friendship that grows between people who are comrades in work or a cause. With Emmeline and Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, too, her happy working relationship developed into lasting friendship when she decided to stay on at Votes for Women in October 1912 after the Pethick-Lawrences withdrew from the WSPU. This was in contrast to the strains and fractures produced in some personal relationships (not always, happily, permanent) by the tactical and ideological differences that developed among suffragists." <Universal> .

In the movement she made such valued new friends as Beatrice Harraden, Ben Webster, and May Whitty. You have a different feeling all your life, she later wrote, about women with whom you have defied the law and risked arrest. She became a close friend of Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson, of Hertha Ayrton, physicist and suffragist, and of Ayrton's daughter, Barbara Gould. These two women, mother and daughter, embodied a thread linking several generations of feminists. Hertha Ayrton (born Phoebe Sarah Marks) had been a prot\u00E9g\u00E9e of Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, and she named her daughter in honour of her mentor: Barbara Bodichon Ayrton, who followed in her mother's suffragist footsteps. Barbara Ayrton married Gerald Gould (an academic) and had a distinguished career in public service as an active socialist and feminist. ES recuperated with Hertha Ayrton after force feeding in prison, and met Marie Curie at her house. She also worked in the United Suffragists with Barbara Gould. Also, because Hertha Ayrton was stepmother to Israel Zangwill's wife, Edith, ES got to know both Zangwills. She called Israel one of the greatest of Jews and a prophet with a sense of humour.

It was, she wrote, the leading force for peace and socialism until after the war She knew most of the leaders of this group, to which she gives several pages in her memoirs. She later came to regard it, however, as a cocoon or cell that kept those inside it from full knowledge of the world outside. During the same period she joined the Labour Party proper, whose coming to power in 1924 signalled the decline of the highly individualistic ILP. She was also an original member of the Union of Democratic Control, formed shortly thereafter by Arthur Ponsonby, E. D. Morel, Ramsay MacDonald, Charles Trevelyan, and Norman Angell (who later won the Nobel Peace Prize). She helped draft the constitution of this body, though she was not a thorough enough Marx ist to agree with its aims. She describes in detail the shock to her thinking caused by the Austro-Serbian conflict in which Russia seemed likely to join and Britain to join in support of Tsarist Russia. Fear rose and blocked thinking. When the next major international event was Germany's invasion of Belgium, most hitherto anti-war Britons thankfully seized on the idea that Germany was in the wrong, and that military opposition was therefore right. The Labour Party's sudden shift to supporting the government on this issue was disorienting to MAH and her friends, who described themselves as pacifists, and who now learned how easily a belief that war was right slid into a belief that war was glorious. While public opinion considered pacifists pro-German and therefore anti-patriotic, Hamilton and others, while realising how obnoxious their behaviour seemed to others, continued to make pacifist speeches and to write pacifist articles. They refused to believe in the war, or to un-say and un-think what we had thought before about war itself: insisted that, having happened, it was still horrific." <Universal> .

She found this move was sneered at some years later at her only meeting with James McNeill Whistler, but she had unfaltering support from her old teacher Miss Spark. She lived at first at a hostel called Brabazon House in Store Street, Bloomsbury ; nevertheless her brothers warned her in strong though indefinite terms of the dangers of living alone in London. Within a year she was doing well enough to exchange this picturesque Grub Street atmosphere for the Victorian Club (later the New Victorian Club) in Sackville Street, the bedrooms on the top floor of which were let off to professional women. From there she moved again, to share with a friend a minute flat in Knightsbridge." <Universal> .

Neither did she want to do office work or become a temperance organiser. January 1905 Mary Agnes Adamson (later MAH ) went to work as assistant to the Professor of History (and head of the department) at the University College of South Wales, Cardiff. She had already, during her time at Cambridge, taught Greek to Katharine, the attractive and clever daughter of Mrs Horner. She now taught British history to theological students and Welsh history to another class, barely managing to keep her own knowledge ahead of theirs." <Universal> .
<EL> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Having earned her bread by work as assistant in a university history department, and as writer, translator, and journalist, MAH entered politics. Journalism continued to provide her main source of income until 1929, and her various writing and editing positions are discussed in her writing document. Her first political activities involved canvassing for others, but in autumn 1923 she stood for parliament, on the shortest possible notice and unsuccessfully, as Labour candidate for the Kentish constituency of Chatham and Rochester in the December election. She abandoned this constituency because a row blew up between her and the agent. She was then taken on, at three weeks' notice, as a candidate for possible selection for Blackburn in Lancashire in October 1924. Here she was so certain she had failed the selection process (having revealed ignorance of the intricacies of short time and insurance payments in the textile trade) that she went back to London on the night train, only to hear next day that she had been selected. Other candidates, equally ignorant, had unlike her tried to conceal their ignorance. The other selected candidate was Harry Gill, president of the Railway Clerks' Association. Having been defeated in the general election of 1924, MAH took two unfurnished rooms in Blackburn, made them habitable for weekends, became a citizen of the town, and secured election at the Flapper Election of May 1929." <Universal> .
<EM> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "MAH sat on the Balfour committee on trade and industry (whose minority report she signed) before she redeemed her former election defeats with success at Blackburn in 1929. In her memoirs she argues that the 1920s and 30s, often dismissed as a mere dark interlude between the two world wars, were a period of steady and purposive social advance at home. They were also the period of her major political contribution. Westminster and elsewhere 30 May 1929-October 1931 MAH sat as Labour Member of Parliament for Blackburn in Lancashire. She won her seat in the Flapper Election and lost it in the landslide victory of the National Coalition government on 27 October 1931. In gaining her seat she polled more votes than any woman standing for Labour. As some male Labour MPs wore red ties, she wore red shoes in the House of Commons, and was soon recognised for impressive professionalism and forceful speeches. Around this time in her career she filled the post of Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Post Master General (then the future Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, who always spoke extremely highly of her). She enjoyed her strenuous years at Westminster, with their comradeship, their common purpose, and their desperate overwork for the women members, who found themselves in exceptional demand. In 1929 and again in 1930 she was a member of the British Delegation to the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva (one of two women delegates sent by Britain), where her most exciting assignment, she said, was on the Refugees Committee. Her memoirs carefully evaluate her League of Nations experience: living in hotels and overfed at formal meals, friends made, ideas exchanged and internationalism supported, all against a background of escalating threats, insufficiently heeded, from bullying Nazi Germany. During 1929-31 she also served as a member of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service. In 1931 she was elected to the parliamentary executive of the Labour Party and often spoke for the government, but the collapse of Labour in the election of 27 October 1931 marked a watershed in her life as well as in that of Britain and Europe. After losing her seat she confined her political activity to speeches and broadcasts. She supported League of Nations sanctions against Italy when it invaded Abyssinia in 1935, and by the Second World War had moved away from her former stance of pacifism. August 1931 The final meeting of the Socialist International was held in Vienna ; Mary Agnes Hamilton attended as one of the Labour Party delegation from Britain. She admired the Viennese civic institutions, endured sniping by the Independent Labour Party against the Labour Party, and was disturbed at the impotence and divided and distracted mind of the German delegations. Civic Work 1 January 1932-31 December 1936 MAH served as a Governor of the British Broadcasting Corporation. She writes first that notice of the appointment came in December 1932, but twice later that she served from 1 January 1932. The head of the Corporation, Sir John Reith, is one of those whose character she draws in her memoirs. She mentions that women drew the same salary as men at the BBC, and compliments the achievements of Hilde Matheson and Isa Benzie, but adds that most women working for the Corporation did so as typists or in the position of secretary (a dead-end job for women but not for men). She wrote to The Times on 17 September 1959 about the failure of the BBC to promote women to top jobs. Her perks as a governor included tickets to concerts and operas, which she much enjoyed. 1937-1940 MAH sat as an Alderman on the London County Council. There were, she observed, a far higher proportion of women in the LCC than in parliament, and, treated on a footing of perfect equality, they pull[ed] their weight without fuss or self-assertion, without the nonsense of forming a specifically female group." <Universal> .
<EN> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "February 1940 MAH acquired her first post as a temporary civil servant ; she held a number of different such positions between now and spring of 1952. During these years, beginning in the Second World War, she worked in the Ministry of Information (where she became head of the American section), the Committee of Ministers for Reconstruction (from spring 1941), the Ministry of Information again, and then from 1946 the Foreign Office. She had decided after the war, somewhat reluctantly, not to return to politics: one of the factors influencing her was the early death on 6 February 1947 (from overwork, Hamilton felt) of Ellen Wilkinson, first woman Labour MP, who had recently been appointed Minister of Education." <Universal> .

<FY> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Initially, MAH was taught by her father, who also coached her in Formal Logic in preparation for her Cambridge Little-go (entrance) examinations. Her parents frequently took their children to the theatre to see the plays of Shakespeare, which they then re-read and acted at home. On a visit to Germany with one of her aunts, while filling in time before she entered university, MAH learned German. Later she learned the rudiments of other European languages while on her travels." <Universal> .
<FZ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Newnham MAH attended Aberdeen Girls' High School (now known as Harlaw Academy), and then, in Glasgow, a large council secondary school (then called a Board School). She also attended a class in Greek taught by J. S. Phillimore of the University of Glasgow (who would not accept the presence of women at his lectures) with a tiny handful of students of Queen Margaret's College, including Nan Philip, who later became a school inspector. She won a scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge when she was to young to be admitted there, and so went off to study in Germany first. Autumn 1901 After seven months studying at the University of Kiel, Mary Agnes Adamson (later Hamilton) entered Newnham College, Cambridge, on a Mathilde Blind Scholarship, an award set up by the distinguished writer. Women were permitted to attend lectures at Kiel only by express permission from each professor involved. Mary Agnes improved her German, learned a great deal about ancient Greece, and also saw productions of most of the plays of Ibsen. Her first year at college was interrupted during her second term by her father's death. She left Newnham in 1904 with a first-class honours BA in classics, history, and economics. She particularly enjoyed Henry Jackson's lectures on Greek philosophy and those of Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson on Political Science. She and her fellow-students were also much inflenced by the ideas of G. E. Moore, J. E. McTaggart, and Jane Ellen Harrison. Hamilton writes that tertiary education for women at the time was still on its trial ; the women students at Newnham were totally separated from the masculine undergraduate population. To her, with her intellectually lively home background, the first experience of university was disappointing rather than anything, but she came to appreciate the privilege of having three years with nothing demanded of her but to grow and learn, instead of being thrust into paid work. While Dorothy Shuckburgh became and remained her closest friend, the older Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick was the most significant person in my time at Cambridge \u2014a time when Henry Sidgwick had just died and his widow was carrying on the struggle to obtain full recognition for women at Cambridge. During her studies at Cambridge, MAH met Lady Burne-Jones, who read to her from the letters of her husband Edward Burne-Jones and of William Morris as well as the poetry of Morris. She also extended her learning by attending public meetings addressed by H. O Meredith and J. M. Keynes on fiscal issues. Most important was the exalted humanism present in the air we breathed and shortly to be formulated in Jane Ellen Harrison's Homo Sum, Being a Letter to an Anti-Suffragist from an Anthropologist, published in her collection Alpha and Omega in 1915. Harrison, wrote Hamilton later, was our most brilliant resident don." <Universal> .

<JR> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "MAH writes: My father and mother were devoted to one another and to us; we adored them, and they created for us an atmosphere which glows and warms as we look back on it. Brothers and sisters liked and like each other. Faults we had, of course. Faults no doubt our parents had. But their love, which comprehended and enfolded us, rayed out to their fellows in... loving-kindness.... Variously gifted and united in a marriage of true minds, they were happy and spread happiness in a wide circle. Mother MAH's mother, born Daisy Duncan but later called Margaret by her husband, was lovely, but completely uninterested in her own looks. She had been under eleven when her Irish Home Ruler father died of smallpox at barely forty leaving seven children. A wealthy Mrs Winkworth from Bolton offered a job as companion to her daughter, and since none of her elder sisters would consent to leave home, Daisy took the job. She left her noisy, talented, egalitarian, undisciplined home for one which was regulated, disciplined, enlightened, rich, comfortable, ugly. But this different household also had something to teach her, and her employer, Emma Winkworth, became her patron and friend, and sent her as a student to Newnham College, Cambridge. After this Daisy took a post as a botany teacher at the Manchester High School for Girls. She worked there until she met her future husband, whom she married in 1881. After her husband's death, Margaret insisted that Mary Agnes and her next brother should continue to pursue their university studies, making the adjustments necessary to accommodate the family's reduced finances: she cooked, she made and mended, she painted and papered with her admirable craftsman's hands. She overcame serious illness after her husband's death, courageously ensured that family life remained warm, zestful, and rewarding for her children, and nurtured their work, applying to it her own passion for perfection. MAH writes of her mother with great love and respect, and records that her death in March of 1935 left her children and friends facing a gap nothing can fill, and contributed to making the next four years, for Mary at least, the worst I have known. Early autumn 1915 MAH's mother and sisters left Edinburgh and came to live at the Mill House, Piccotts End in Hertfordshire ; it made a great difference to Hamilton (already a long-term resident of England) to have them near her. Here they reclaimed the derelict garden, worked hard at various artistic pursuits which brought in a small income, and entertained most of MAH's friends. Father MAH's father, Robert Adamson, educated at Edinburgh University, became Professor of Logic and Metaphysics successively at Owens College (later merged in Manchester University), and the Universities of Aberdeen and then Glasgow. His friends included Gilbert Murray, A. C. Bradley, and Helena Swanwick. Apart from teaching his children outdoor skills on family holidays, he walked Mary Agnes daily to her first school in Aberdeen, talking with her all the way as to an intellectual equal, and dropping words of advice which she remembered all her life. Later they used to enjoy detective stories together: both Conan Doyle and Anna Katharine Green, who preceded him in the genre. Mary Agnes's father's death at the age of only fifty-two, in early 1902 (when she was just beginning her second term at university), was a devastating blow to her and her family, both emotionally and financially, marking a Great Divide in their lives. Other Relations MAH's brother Stephen, the closest to her in age, was extremely shy as a child. He became a botanist and settled in South Africa. Her next two sisters, Una and Sarah, were talented needlewomen and visual artists. Her youngest sister, Margot, became a poet and miscelleous writer, whose twenty or so books began with the poetry volume A Year of War, and Other Poems, 1917. The Aunts, four unusually gifted but overpoweringly critical sisters of her mother and one particularly beloved sister of her father, were very important to children whose grandparents were all dead." <Universal> .
<JS> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "12 September 1905 The year after she took her degree MAH married economist Charles J. Hamilton. Her marriage was brief, unhappy, and childless ; it is not mentioned either in her autobiography or in Who's Who following her death. In her own words she became engaged, most unwisely, to a colleague, and gave up teaching for matrimony. She wrote later that it was her mother-in-law (who could not forgive her for retain[ing] a happy disposition and... many friends ) who broke up her marriage. She and her husband soon separated." <Universal> .

But this different household also had something to teach her, and her employer, Emma Winkworth, became her patron and friend, and sent her as a student to Newnham College, Cambridge. After this Daisy took a post as a botany teacher at the Manchester High School for Girls. She worked there until she met her future husband, whom she married in 1881. After her husband's death, Margaret insisted that Mary Agnes and her next brother should continue to pursue their university studies, making the adjustments necessary to accommodate the family's reduced finances: she cooked, she made and mended, she painted and papered with her admirable craftsman's hands. She overcame serious illness after her husband's death, courageously ensured that family life remained warm, zestful, and rewarding for her children, and nurtured their work, applying to it her own passion for perfection. MAH writes of her mother with great love and respect, and records that her death in March of 1935 left her children and friends facing a gap nothing can fill, and contributed to making the next four years, for Mary at least, the worst I have known. Early autumn 1915 MAH's mother and sisters left Edinburgh and came to live at the Mill House, Piccotts End in Hertfordshire ; it made a great difference to Hamilton (already a long-term resident of England) to have them near her. Here they reclaimed the derelict garden, worked hard at various artistic pursuits which brought in a small income, and entertained most of MAH's friends." <Universal> .
<KB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Father MAH's father, Robert Adamson, educated at Edinburgh University, became Professor of Logic and Metaphysics successively at Owens College (later merged in Manchester University), and the Universities of Aberdeen and then Glasgow. His friends included Gilbert Murray, A. C. Bradley, and Helena Swanwick. Apart from teaching his children outdoor skills on family holidays, he walked Mary Agnes daily to her first school in Aberdeen, talking with her all the way as to an intellectual equal, and dropping words of advice which she remembered all her life. Later they used to enjoy detective stories together: both Conan Doyle and Anna Katharine Green, who preceded him in the genre. Mary Agnes's father's death at the age of only fifty-two, in early 1902 (when she was just beginning her second term at university), was a devastating blow to her and her family, both emotionally and financially, marking a Great Divide in their lives." <Universal> .

What she understands by abnormal manifestations of sexuality, such as very close bonds between women, provoked a distaste in Hamilton and members of her group, which she terms instinctive and wholly ignorant. Thinking back, she felt later that their ignorance was of its time; and intensely English. A young Italian woman who became a member of their group was able to provide information, which MAH did not at the time particularly appreciate." <Universal> .

<PF> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "MAH travelled in Europe a great deal. While waiting to take up her scholarship at Cambridge, she visited Germany on her first trip abroad, visiting Hamburg with her aunt and then staying for seven months in Kiel, a small and charming town. She revisited Germany many times between then and 1934, drawn there, more strongly than to France, by her knowledge of the language and her feelings for German literature and German music. These and her other European travels were always inflected with an acute and carefully nourished understanding of local politics. She later felt that she had shared a general British ignorance about France which had bad consequences politically. Summer 1910 MAH visited Venice and Florence with her friend Dorothy Shuckburgh. This was the first of many visits to Italy for MAH. One of these was a longish stay in a villa on Lake Garda with her sister Margot in October-November 1926, when Fascist rule was just beginning to make itself felt. Earlier 1914 Before war broke out, MAH crossed the Atlantic for the first of her travels to North America, visiting Quebec City and Montreal, then going on to New York. She loved Montreal but failed to see New York on this occasion; she saw it and experienced its strange charm in 1923. She was back in the USA for lecture tours in 1927, 1928, 1930, and 1932 (on which occasion she visited Washington for the first time). She returned home from this trip in May after a four-month tour. After another lecture tour of the USA in 1938, she was there again in 1941 under the auspices of the Ministry of Reconstruction to publicise William Beveridge's proposals for setting up a Welfare State in Britain after the end of the war, and in November 1942 she made a trip that took in Canada as well as the United States. On this last occasion she felt more at home with the tension, drabness, and determination of Canadian society, marked like her own by three years of conflict, than in the cheerful, colourful surroundings of an America which had been at war for less than a year. 1923 MAH enjoyed her first of many travels to Austria and countries formerly part of the Austrian Empire: she visited Vienna and then Budapest and Prague. Like Germany and North America, Austria became a regular destination and she made a number of ongoing friendships there. She visited in 1928, 1934 (when the shadow of Nazism was already perceptible), 1936, and in September 1937, when conditions were approaching the desperate. At this point in her memoirs MAH details the fates of her friends: how this one died in a concentration camp and that group made it alive to Australia. September 1933 MAH (in her own words) touched the summit of my European holidays in going to Greece. This glorious journey included a four-week stay in Athens. Ignoring dire warnings that she ought to take pistols, against perilous dogs; thick underclothing, against pervasive insect life; remedies, of dubious efficacy, against the heat, she and her holiday companion, Ray Strachey, travelled by steamer from Venice to Greece, and then by car around the Peloponnese and several of the islands. 1936 MAH took two of her sisters on a trip to Rouen, Chartres, and Paris. This was a step towards remedying what she terms her long neglect of France. She was back there again several times in 1939. In general she was more strongly drawn by Germany, the country of her first European experience. Its postwar poverty, gallopping inflation, and later the rise of Nazism, were no deterrent to a traveller deeply interested in political issues. Summer 1939 MAH felt that she was visiting Switzerland for the first time on a holiday at St Moritz, since before this she had been in the country only for work purposes, attending meetings in Geneva." <Universal> .

<QU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "She contributed to the monthly War and Peace (1913-18) as well as to Common Sense, and she left Common Sense, in about 1920, only when it was about to fold. After this, briefly, she worked for Philip Gibbs on the Review of Reviews \u2014where almost her first duty was to deputise for Gibbs as editor during three months which he spent in the USA. It was, she said, magnanimous of him to appoint her, since she had first come to his notice in connection with a piece she wrote for Time and Tide which was critical of him." <Universal> .
<QV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Many of MAH's friends were drawn from Things that Matter or Political : from the latter came her admiring friendship for Marion Rowntree (later Wilkinson). Her three closest friends were Jacqueta Northcote, Dorothy Shuckburgh (who felt badly about the fact that she was not invited to join Things that Matter, not being judged sufficiently brilliant or witty), and Margery Corbett, who was later active in Liberal politics and, as a committed feminist, President of Women's International Conferences. Besides these three, MAH mentions a wealth of other friendships she contracted at Cambridge, many of them with women and men later active in public life. Her friends were soon augmented by contacts from the world of work, like F. W. Hirst and Josef Redlich. Barbara and Laurence Hammond (a married pair of social commentators whose work was collaborative in the manner of the Webbs) were the friends who drew MAH's mother and sisters from Edinburgh to live in their neighbourhood. Hamilton's socialist principles brought her into contact with many members of the Bloomsbury group. The neo-pagan Ka Cox was a good friend, and the one who put her in touch with Virginia Woolf. Hamilton saw a good deal of Woolf after the first world war, and deeply admired her writing. But she came to the reluctant conclusion that Woolf did not warm to her." <Universal> .
<QW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "5 August 1914 The day after war was declared, MAH was taken to meet Vernon Lee, a writer she much admired, who was then staying at the London home ( 44 Bedford Square ) of Lady Ottoline and Philip Morrell. One of Lee's beliefs, pronounced that evening, was: Patriotism... is the power to be ashamed of your country. MAH credits Lady Ottoline with holding the pacifist movement together; many meetings took place at 44 Bedford Square, where those ususally present included Bertrand Russell, Lytton Strachey, J. M. Keynes, E. D. Morel, Adrian Stephen, Leonard Woolf, Desmond MacCarthy, Julian and Aldous Huxley, Clive Bell, Gerald Shove, Duncan Grant, Mark Gertler, and H. W. Massingham. Others who attended occasionally were D. H. Lawrence, G. D. H. Cole, Gilbert Cannan, Siegfried Sassoon, and Lady Margaret Sackville. Principia Mathematica by Russell and A. N. Whitehead was very influential among the group." <Universal> .
<QX> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "MAH knew and worked closely with the Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald, though her early intense admiration for him diminished with time. Up to the year after publishing her book on him (which was also the year Mac became Prime Minister) she was a devotee, but from 1924 onwards a loyal but critical follower. In 1931, she says, [s]ome virtue went out of him. She also entertained warm feelings towards other political colleagues, such Philip, Viscount Snowden, Arthur Henderson, and Hugh Dalton, even when she sometimes disagreed with them. Having met Beatrice Webb in unpropitious circumstances, as a young and frightened opponent of her in public debate, she later found both Beatrice and Sidney Webb extremely kind. Outside the field of politics, MAH was a regular during the first world war at a weekly lunchtime gathering of journalists where Naomi Royde-Smith (who became the centre of her literary-social as opposed to her political life) was also a steady attender. She was thrilled at meeting Henry James, her literary idol, in probably 1917 at the home of an American friend. The meeting satisfied every hero-worshipping instinct. Other writers who became valued friends were Marie Belloc Lowndes and Susan Ertz. MAH's memoirs give detailed and affectionate pen-portraits of innumerable friends, made both at home and in many of the other countries she travelled or worked in. Many of her English friends are known names in the story of British politics, many of them married couples (including the suffragist writer Evelyn Sharp and the husband of her later years, Henry W. Nevinson ). Hamilton once stayed at Salzburg with a university contemporary, the American Ethel Bagg, later Bullard, later Salter, when a fellow-guest was Clemence Dane. She enjoyed a close friendship with Ray Strachey, with whom she went to Greece in summer 1933. While in Chicago she spent very good hours with Jane Addams of Hull House, although Settlements were not something she generally enjoyed. She became a friend of Felix Frankfurter and his wife Marion at about the time that he was appointed to the US Supreme Court. (She notes wryly that Felix was disowned by his family for marrying a Christian, and Marion disowned by her family for marrying a Jew.) She describes, without naming names, her friendship with a German singer of Wagnerian roles, first met when he sang Tristan at Covent Garden in 1923. She met him nine years later in New York, found innumerable interests in common, and in 1934 accepted an invitation to stay with him and his wife (an ex-singer) in Bavaria. There her friend's present political opinions gradually emerged in diatribes against the USA and against Jewish people in the musical world. When eventually they came to a quarrel, it was about the position of woman. MAH dispatched a telegram to myself and departed, seriously shaken by the experience. Working for the Ministry of Information during World War Two, she became friendly with the distinguished novelist Phyllis Bentley, whose warmth and strength of feeling she found attractive if sometimes hard on herself and her colleagues." <Universal> .
