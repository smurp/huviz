A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey to honour her a few weeks later. The Manchester Guardian called her a great reformer, and the Oxford Mail the Mother of Women's Suffrage. Her memorial in Westminster Abbey (erected in 1932 ) says that she won citizenship for women. She commissioned Ray Strachey, her life-long friend, to be her official biographer; but a feminist of a later generation, Ann Oakley, has speculated that she probably required from Strachey discretion and even self-censorship. Strachey was proud to be writing the life of the friend she loved and admired and set out to bring to the task her subject's own lifelong adherence to even judgement, quiet conviction, and humorous breadth of vision. She notes that MGF lived by her own credo of unshaken reasonableness... and consequently her biography contains nothing sensational. She writes that it was Fawcett's nature, rather than the extraordinary story of her life, that made her a woman whose life Strachey wanted to portray as an example to future generations." <Universal> .

However, she always felt that he had helped her beliefs to evolve from atheism toward spirituality.

Essentially, they were socialists, who opposed the racist, imperialist, and capitalist policies of the South African leaders.

OS advocated the Boer cause during the Boer war, 1899-1902, then turned away from White politics to support the rights of Black South Africans. She spoke passionately on their behalf at the 1908 National Convention. Suffrage Movement OS was involved with suffrage organizations and women's trade unions. In South Africa she was vice-president of the Women's Enfranchisement League, but resigned because she believed in the franchise for all women of the Cape Colony, not just white women. OS scrawled this message across the WEL's published statement of purpose, which advocated the vote for women on the same terms as men. Pacifist Movement OS did not support the use of violence. As a pacifist, she disapproved of Emmeline Pankhurst's militant feminism. (She was a personal friend, however, of Sylvia Pankhurst.)

<BLD> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "10 December 1920 OS died peacefully during the night, with her reading-glasses on and a book in her hand, at Oak Hall, the boarding house in Wynberg, South Africa, where she was living. There is no explanation of why Cronwright did not come to South Africa immediately. He cabled his brother to make arrangements for both her possessions and her burial, which took place in complete silence with no religious ceremony, according to what he felt she would want. A number of people, many of them women, joined the procession to the grave, although there had been no announcement of the burial. Cronwright travelled to South Africa six weeks later. On 13 August 1921 Samuel Cronwright had OS's body exhumed and taken up the mountain Buffels Hoek to its summit, Buffels Kop. There the couple had arranged for themselves, their baby daughter, and their dog to be buried, in accordance with instructions left in Schreiner's will. Cronwright chose this date for the reinterment as it marked the first anniversary of their final parting in London." <Universal> .

<BME> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The book elicited strong reactions, most of them positive. It was highly praised by Philip Kent, who wrote a long article about it instead of his usual shorter reviews in Life, a weekly journal. Kent compared it favourably with Balzac's Le P\u00E8re Goriot, Bront\u00EB's Jane Eyre, and Eliot's Adam Bede. Historian W. E. Lecky termed OS's book one of the best novels in the English language. Prime Minister William Gladstone wrote an approving memorandum about its concept of holiness on Downing Street notepaper. OS was cheered by one cleric's positive response to the novel's take on religion. However, according to playwright and pacifist Laurence Housman, the book was also taken to task for bad morals, and caused one female reader to take it up in the tongs and put it upon the fire. The book is a landmark text. In an introduction to an edition of 1968, Doris Lessing (who first read it when she was fourteen) identified it as one of the few rare books... which is on a frontier of the human mind. According to Elaine Showalter in another introduction twenty-five years later, it was one of the first to demonstrate to South African writers that serious literature could be created out of the harsh, unromantic material of South African colonial life. Showalter also notes that its strong, independent heroine won Schreiner the reputation among feminists as a feminist intellectual of the stature of Mary Wollstonecraft, Virginia Woolf, and Simone de Beauvoir." <Universal> .
<BMF> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The book was a particular delight to women readers, but its popularity extended to people of both genders and all classes. Lady Constance Lytton later recalled that her father and the artist George Frederic Watts were enthusiastic over its poetical beauty. Lytton herself read and re-read the allegories at their first publication for sheer emotional joy, without at that time penetrating to their feminist meaning. While most reviews were very positive, a few took exception to its treatment of religious and political issues. In early 1909 in Holloway Prison, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence recited the whole four pages of Three Dreams in a Desert to a group of Freedom League suffragettes illicitly celebrating their impending release. It was then that Constance Lytton first understood this sketch as hardly an allegory at all, but a bare literal description of the pilgrimage of women, and concluded: There is some point, some purpose in [literature] after all." <Universal> .
<BMG> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "They were likewise very popular." <Universal> .
<BMH> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Both publishers' readers and, later, reviewers disapproved of the fictional use of Christ. They also had trouble with the book's highflown style. The book's first, generous print-run sold out rapidly; it became a popular sensation, and was quickly translated into Swedish, German, Danish, Dutch, and French. Readers in Britain and Southern Africa responded differently from each other: many of the latter were outraged by the attack on Rhodes. Schreiner was extremely disappointed, however, that it utterly failed to effect political change: In spite of its immense circulation, she wrote, I do not believe it has saved the life of one nigger. However, she was glad she had written it, and said she would like that fact mentioned on her tombstone. Critic Liz Stanley feels that in recent years the work has been unjustly neglected." <Universal> .
<BMI> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "To Vera Brittain and some of her contemporaries, Women and Labour was the Bible of the Women's Movement. It influenced the writings of many early-twentieth-century feminists, including historian Alice Clark and suffragette Constance Lytton (its dedicatee). In the US, writer Floyd Dell compared OS to globally influential women such as feminist economist Charlotte Perkins Gilman, dancer Isadora Duncan, social worker Jane Addams, and Swedish sociologist Ellen Key. In the 1940s, Doris Lessing echoed Schreiner's views in A Proper Marriage, in making her heroine Martha Quest, when she has to manage a house in Rhodesia, feel that she is living like the women Schreiner described." <Universal> .
<BMJ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Clayton considers that this unwieldy novel is a result of the multifaceted nature of Schreiner's life experiences, and the various perspectives she had of them over time. She also notes that it reflects historical changes in South Africa, and the way that Schreiner lived sometimes inside and sometimes outside it. Schreiner's biographers Ruth First and Ann Scott term it a serious attempt to explore the nature of sexual deception. Both believe that OS herself saw the book as her most important work." <Universal> .
<BMK> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Biographers Ruth First and Ann Scott call the book both Undine's and Olive's story, and Cherry Clayton agrees with them that it is Schreiner's first transition from the diary to the novel form. To First and Scott, the novel is raw, relatively undifferentiated from Schreiner's own experience, and overtly split between a critique of culture and a sentimental endorsement of it. Clayton finds the style rather stilted and ornate, compared with later writing by OS, but notes that the same themes and tropes later reappear. In 1884 Schreiner wrote to Havelock Ellis that she had not looked at this novel since writing it, and ought to have burnt it long ago, but could not bring herself to do so because of its autobiographical elements." <Universal> .
<BML> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "March 1924 Schreiner's widower, S. C. Cronwright-Schreiner, published his biography of her, The Life of Olive Schreiner \u2014the first and most influential of many biographies. Cronwright dedicated the book to her friend Havelock Ellis, whom he had previously asked to write the biography. Ellis felt unable to fulfill the request, but offered Cronwright all the information he had." <Universal> .
<BMM> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "OS's writings were promptly translated into French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, and rapidly achieved high world-wide sales. Constance Lytton felt that more than any other author, OS rightly interpreted the woman's movement and symbolised and immortalised it by her writings. The Olive Schreiner Letters Project at the University of Edinburgh (website at www.oliveschreinerletters.ed.ac.uk) has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council to transcribe, analyse and publish the complete text of Schreiner's 7,000 or so extant letters (mostly unpublished) which survive in archives around the world." <Universal> .

Matthew Arnold pronounced it very pleasantly written, as well as full of things that are true. The Athen\u00E6um review considered the book evidence that debate over women's education had taken a positive turn, but found ED's views wanting in practical application. Pronouncing that a medical career would deprive women of all that makes womanhood good and lovely, it preferred the more poetical view of female destiny given in the essentialist arguments of the anonymous book which it reviewed alongside Davies, Thoughts Relative to the Education of Women on the Principles of Modern Science." <Universal> .
<CJ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "ED's writings have become an important part of the archive of the struggle for women's education in England. The Higher Education of Women has been reprinted, as have shorter pieces collected in a number of anthologies ( Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon and the Langham Place Group, edited by Candida Ann Lacey; The Education Papers, edited by Dale Spender). Her papers at Girton include the unpublished manuscript which she referred to as the Family Chronicle, which describes her early life, but from which the hundred pages dealing with the years 1849-61 (present when Barbara Stephen wrote her biography of ED published in 1927) are now missing. The pages covering 1861-8, however, convey little information that is not available elsewhere. The manuscript includes passages (no personal ones) transcribed from her letter s. Other letters survive in this archive, but many were probably destroyed. Her extant letters to men (of which there are a good many) include none to any one of a number of eminent figures with whom she is known to have corresponded. ED herself liked to attribute the gains she had made for the women's movement to the collaborative efforts of other women besides herself. This was not modesty so much as a political, feminist sense of the indispensability of the group." <Universal> .
<CK> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Mother ED's mother, Mary (Hopkinson) Davies, was the daughter of a well-off family which had made its money in business and land investment. She died in 1886, when Emily was in her fifties." <Universal> .
<CL> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Father ED's father, John Davies, became the evangelical rector of Gateshead, near Newcastle, where he also ran a school. Because his health was precarious (he suffered a series of breakdowns), the family moved often, hoping to find a climate amenable to his constitution. They finally settled at Gateshead in November 1839. Before ED's birth, her father was offered a Chair of moral and political economy at London University after having published two well-received books. He turned down the offer because the \u00A5300 salary was not guaranteed. He died in October 1861. Siblings Of the five children, only Emily and Llewelyn (the eldest child and later rector of Christ Church, Marylebone ) survived to mature adulthood. In January 1858 Jane died young of tuberculosis, and William died in China in October the same year, after serving as a chaplain in the Crimea. Henry died, also of tuberculosis, the following year. Margaret Llewelyn Davies of the Women's Cooperative Guild, friend of Virginia Woolf, was ED's niece." <Universal> .
<CM> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "ED's early awareness of the movement for women's education developed through her brother Llewelyn's involvement with F. D. Maurice in Queen's College, Harley Street, London. Llewelyn became Principal of the College from 1873 to 1886." <Universal> .

<PK> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "MGF's name became in time so identified with the suffrage struggle that a story arose depicting her sister Elizabeth and Emily Davies entrusting the issue of suffrage to her when she was a little girl. At that time, according to the story, Elizabeth and Emily dedicated themselves to winning women entry to the medical profession and to higher education respectively. MGF was a member of the first Women's Suffrage Committee, formed in July 1867 after John Stuart Mill proposed his suffrage amendment in parliament. She was the youngest woman at the initial gathering. At that time many women, including her sister Elizabeth, were not willing to have their names associated publicly with the committee. MGF gave her first speech at its second public meeting, which was held in London, and became one of its leading figures in the 1870s. She took over Lydia Becker's role as official Parliamentary agent of the National Societies for Women's Suffrage (later the NUWSS ) when Becker died in 1890. For almost her entire life she worked for the full enfranchisement of women, though she really believed that this reform could come about only as one item in wider social change. She firmly believed in her husband's liberal philosophy of individualism and self-help, and thus did not support political lobbying in favour of free education, cheaper food, lower taxes, mothers' pensions, or family allowances. On the other hand, as she makes clear in her autobiography, she saw the suffrage struggle as being for the benefit of the entire community\u2014it was an effort not just for women, but for the good of society as a whole. For her, Women' Suffrage was only one issue, along with education, morals, and employment, which were of equal importance. law and legislation politics By early 1894 MGF launched a crusade against a Conservative MP, Henry Cust, who had seduced a girl of good family and rejected her appeals to him to marry her now that she was pregnant. He jeeringly read out her letters of protest to his male friends. Fawcett informed the local Women's Liberal Unionist Association of the affair. She succeeded in preventing Cust from standing for parliament again, and he married the young woman. When no libel action ensued, MGF persisted in her campaign. Her anger on this occasion was unusual for her, and she was urged by many, even her friends, to desist. Cust's new wife was among those who implored her to call a halt to her efforts against him. 14 October 1897 to January 1919 MGF was President of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She held office until the NUWSS changed its name at a council meeting in January 1919, following the victory of 1918. The organisation was formed by consolidating all the local societies working for Women's Suffrage. By 1907, however, MGF turned definitively against the policy of direct action, which had become linked especially with the name of Emmeline Pankhurst. She dissociated herself from suffragette violence and civil disobedience (although she admitted to being moved by their physical courage, and although her sister Elizabeth \u2014and Elizabeth's daughter, Louisa Garrett Anderson \u2014were by then or soon afterwards in the ranks of the demonstrators). She succeeded in preventing the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies from being taken over by the militants within it. Later, she was instrumental in another, very deep, schism in the movement because of her conviction that suffrage work would have to wait until after the First World War had been won. The resulting rift within the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies caused her great personal distress. Again, she stood firm, and those who opposed her views resigned. Yet suffrage did not cease to be her goal. She was instrumental, after the passing of the Representation of the People Act giving the vote to women over thirty in February 1918, in getting the musician Sir Hubert Parry (a descendant of the family which included Bach ) to write his setting of Blake's Jerusalem for a celebration in March. In the year of her death, MGF wrote of finding it quite delightful... that now everyone takes the woman voter as if she had existed from the time of Adam and Eve. Her practicality was unquestioned, as her colleague and sometime opponent Eleanor Rathbone observed after her death: She saw the end from the beginning and the unity which transcended all our differences. When the vote was finally extended to all women over twenty-one in May 1928, MGF was present. That evening she wrote that it was sixty-one years since John Stuart Mill introduced the suffrage amendment to the Reform Bill, and she was present then too: I have had the extraordinary good luck in having seen the struggle from the beginning. 2 July 1928 MGF made a great effort to get herself and her friends to the ceremony marking the final Women's Suffrage occasion, as the latest Representation of the People Act received Royal Assent with the words, Le roi le veult. On Not Standing for Parliament MGF was acutely aware of the potential represented by members of parliament, as is shown in her initiative in founding the Speaker's Conference on Electoral Reform in 1916, to bring together MPs who were prepared to support the suffragists. After the suffrage had at last been extended to some women by the Representation of the People Act in February 1918, and an election was in prospect, MGF was asked to stand for parliament. She replied that she had seventy-three reasons not to do so: one for each year of her age, plus the fact she did not want to! Lady Astor did stand and became the first woman member of the House of Commons in 1919. She said that she felt almost ashamed to take that place instead of Millicent Fawcett, but Fawcett was glad to see her elected. She herself continued to take part in the work of the London and National Society for Women's Service. On Law After she retired from active involvement with Women's Suffrage work, MGF was particularly involved in gaining entry for women into the legal profession. 1920 Because of her political work to ensure that the Sex Disqualification Removal Bill gave women access to all positions in the legal profession on 23 December 1919, MGF was one of the first women to be appointed Justice of the Peace. And Other Political Issues Apart from the suffrage issue, MGF's political attitudes were those of the Liberal Party of the Victorian era. Though she strongly supported education for girls, she opposed universal free education (and the family allowances supported by Eleanor Rathbone ) out of a belief that people would value more highly something that they had to pay for. She opposed Home Rule for Ireland, and took a patriotic stance in the Boer War before doing the same thing in the First World War. Her respect for English political institutions and the English national character were a strength in her campaigning for electoral change. The National Vigilance Association For many years, MGF was active in the National Vigilance Association (also known as the Vigilance Society ), which was formed in 1881 with a view to protecting young girls of thirteen and over from being sold into white slavery. It also helped young women who had been seduced or assaulted, and followed some of their cases which were brought to court. Her cousin Rhoda Garrett was very much involved with this work, in which MGF became active in 1885." <Universal> .

They blamed high death-rates on the uncivilised health practices of the (Boer) inmates. As a consequence, MGF gained a reputation as a real diehard Conservative, an ardent Imperialist, and a militarist, even a hard and wicked woman, willing to uphold any authority and having no regard for right and wrong. She disregarded her critics and went on with her work." <Universal> .

MGF's honours did not spring primarily from her writing. However, her writing was an important part of the activist career for which she was recognised. This was the first awarding of such an honour to any woman for any reason. MGF was delighted, but felt that she was being honoured for the work of many. She stated her belief that all those who had worked for improved education for women will feel that it is their cause which has received honour at your hands." <Universal> .

She was warmly congratulated not only by friends and public bodies, but by women in general: Scores of women whom she had never seen took this opportunity of telling her that she had altered and influenced their lives. She answered each one, reiterating that the award for her suffrage work was given not only to her, but to all the colleagues who shared the work with her." <Universal> .

When Garrett found her studies at Middlesex Hospital impeded by the medical profession's prejudice against women, ED helped her to campaign for women to be admitted to London University and to the medical profession: they advertised nationally in newspapers, soliciting responses from other women interested in pursuing medical studies, and they canvassed names for a petition submitted to the university. In 1862 the university's Senate rejected the petition and refused to allow Garrett to matriculate. Garrett successfully passed the Society of Apothecaries' exam in 1865, and had her name entered on the British Medical Register in 1866. She earned her medical degree in 1870 in Paris. Education Women's Higher Education October 1862 ED formed a committee to obtain the admission of women to university examinations. Women and Education Committee members included Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, Elizabeth Bostock, Isa Craig, Russell Gurney, G. W. Hastings, James Heywood, and Louisa, Lady Goldsmid. In 1863, the Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate permitted arrangements to be made for a private experimental examination of girls. The Committee was dissolved in August 1869 after women had been admitted to the Cambridge Junior and Senior Local Examinations. The Committee's financial balance of \u00A518 18s. 11d was given to Elizabeth Garrett so that she might pursue her medical studies. Education Other Education Work ED worked hard to get female education on the public and state agenda through the work of the Taunton or Schools Inquiry Commission. The Commission's mandate to consider middle-class education did not exclude girls, but it became apparent that their education was not likely to be investigated. ED and her colleagues working for women's higher education organized a memorial to the Committee, signed by prominent members of society and educators of women, which led to the mandate of the Assistant Commissioners being extended to girls' schools as well as boys'. November 1865 ED and Frances Mary Buss gave evidence before the Schools Inquiry Commission, ensuring that girls' education would figure in its influential report. Education Women and Education Six other women testified shortly afterwards. 9 March 1866 Largely through ED's desire to foster professional ties among women educators, the London Schoolmistresses' Association was formed at a meeting at her house in London. Education Women and Education 30 November 1870 ED was elected to the London School Board as a member for Greenwich. Women and Education The Education Act of 1870 allowed for the election of women to School Boards; ED's prominence as an education activist is evident in her election as only the second woman (following Elizabeth Garrett ) to hold one of the new positions in London. Lydia Becker was also elected to the Manchester School Board and Flora Stevenson to the Edinburgh School Board. ED and Garrett resigned in 1873, claiming that there was far too much work related to girls' education to be done by two persons." <Universal> .

Education Women and Education ED's petition was a request for funding to establish a College for women. It was signed by 521 teachers of girls and 175 others, including Robert Browning, George Grote, Thomas Huxley, Charles Lyell, James Martineau, John Ruskin, and Alfred Lord Tennyson. A College Committee was struck and met for the first time on 5 December 1867. ED approached Lady Stanley about sitting on the committee, but she declined. A meeting held on 28 March 1868 at the Architectural Gallery attracted an audience of 200 and helped boost the College's subscription list. George Eliot contributed \u00A550 and was inspired to recruit other subscribers. In August 1868, sub-committees were struck to draft a constitution for the college and to develop a college curriculum. Despite her commitment to equal standards of education, ED felt that the artificial separation of boys and girls during earlier education made it impossible to have integrated university lectures and thought it wisest to situate the college outside the town of Cambridge. Nevertheless, she was absolutely opposed to the idea of different standards and examinations for women, and was dismayed when a special exam for women was instituted in 1869 by the Cambridge Senate. She felt that Cambridge had in so doing put its stamp on the principle that women's education is to be lower and narrower than that of men. Her ultimate aim, eventually achieved, was for the College to be a full member of the University and for its students to gain degrees on the same grounds as men. Under the direction of Charlotte Manning, five students began studying at the College at Benslow House, Hitchin, in October 1869. Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon donated some sketches to decorate the walls of the house, and George Eliot and George Henry Lewes donated some of their books to the library. Emily Shirreff began to serve as headmistress of the College in the Lent Term of 1870. Education 15 May 1872 Girton College was formally constituted through the adoption of its Memorandum and Articles of Association. This year ED was appointed Mistress of the college (which was still at Hitchin ). Education Women and Education The College applied for incorporation as an Association under the Board of Trade in order to establish its legal existence. The document drawn up by the College's Committee professed the College's affiliation with both the University of Cambridge and the Church of England.
