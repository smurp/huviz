At Radcliffe College she learned from William James his philosophy of Pragmatism: I like a thing simple but it must be simple through complication.... A great deal of this I owe to a great teacher William James. Living in Paris, she saw her writing in direct relationship with artistic productions by C\u00E9zanne, Matisse, Picasso, and other revolutionary painters of the time. Cubism's distortion of perspective and play with form influenced her intellectually as well as aesthetically. She wanted to break the temporal progress of beginning, middle, and end, to create a narrative capable of conveying everything at once. Her subject became the structure of representation... [and] not what is represented itself ; she gave herself the authority to compose without direct reference, to free the activity of signifying from the necessity of representing the thing as if language were transparent." <Universal> .

<BEL> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "GS's politics were equivocal and often conservative. She was not explicitly feminist, yet many critics have celebrated her early writings on female lives and relationships as pro-feminist. GS writes in Everybody's Autobiography that she and Toklas made special efforts to participate in events hosted by and featuring women: when the women writers asked us to tea we had to go. GS's friendship with and acceptance of support from Bernard Fa\u00FF, who was imprisoned after the war for collaboration with the Nazis, troubled many who felt that through this association she was guilty of crimes of omission and wilful ignorance. As Jewish women well into their sixties, both Stein and Toklas were terrified by the likelihood of internment during the occupation of France. It seems highly likely, as Fa\u00FF himself said in a memoir published in 1966, that he was instrumental in keeping Stein and Toklas invisible to the German army. It seems also that he hid from them his own intense anti-semitism. Critic Edwin Burgum, a contemporary of Stein's, used the publication of Wars I Have Seen (1945) to denounce her apolitical stance. He characterized her as one of the simple persons, uninterested in politics and unaccustomed to the larger issue, overlooking Stein's voluntary efforts in the First World War (which had earned her a Reconnaissance Fran\u00E7aise)." <Universal> .

Re-evaluating the novel, critic Richard Bridgman finds that it is mainly an outlet for genius to... make its own unimaginable way. Terry Castle has called it the looming, cloud-capped, mindwarping Everest of the Steinian oeuvre, which is so visually and verbally dense, page by page, with a restricted vocabulary, programmatic syntactical permutations and deadening repetition. Janet Malcolm judges it cathartic, a great outpouring of grief and anger and sorrow and doubt, making a dark, death-ridden book whose reader, because of its difficulty, may feel like an uninvited guest." <Universal> .

In February 1935, transition, the review that had strongly supported GS's experimental writings in previous years, published responses by those who felt mistreated by the book. Eugene Jolas wrote that these responses invalidate the claim of the Toklas-Stein memorial that Miss Stein was in any way concerned with the shaping of the epoch she attempts to describe. Matisse denied that GS had anything to do with the purchase of Femme au chapeau, and Maria Jolas, co-editor of transition, accused Stein of ingratitude to all those who had helped her in the early years. Braque, who co-invented cubism with Picasso, declared that GS's French was so bad that she could barely take part in conversations: she never went beyond the stage of the tourist.

GS sent a request to an American cousin, Fred Stein, for a car, and in early 1917 he raised enough money to ship her a Ford. Stein and Toklas travelled to Perpignan in south-west France, N\u00EEmes, and Alsace to deliver supplies to the wounded. This work was vitally important for Stein and Alice Toklas. In 1918 Stein sold their treasured Matisse painting, Femme au chapeau, to Sally Stein for $500 to sustain their volunteer and relief efforts. 1919 GS and Alice Toklas were awarded the Reconnaissance Fran\u00E7aise for their voluntary war efforts." <Universal> .

After many unsuccessful attempts to see GS's manuscripts into print, Alice Toklas became Stein's adventurous publisher. Stein sold Picasso's Femme \u00E0 l'\u00E9ventail in order to finance the venture. Toklas persuaded bookshops in Paris to use their editions in window displays. Collectors in America responded eagerly. Five volumes were published before Stein's fame made the business unnecessary: Lucy Church Amiably, Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship Faded, How to Write, Operas and Plays, and Matisse Picasso and Gertrude Stein." <Universal> .
<BHT> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "May 1926 GS delivered lectures at Cambridge and Oxford Universities; these were later published by the Hogarth Press. Persuaded by Edith Sitwell and Harold Acton, GS agreed to a small lecture tour. She lectured about grammar and literature. She was apparently inspired to explicate her ideas on composition, rhythm, repetition and identity while driving in her Ford car. October 1934-April 1935 GS went on a lecture tour of universities across the United States, where she was greeted by the media as the Sybil of Montparnasse. On October 24 1934 she was greeted with effusive press coverage in New York. At Columbia University she had been expected to give four lectures to audiences of approximately two hundred each. However, the university warned her that because of all the publicity she should expect more than a thousand. She told the university that her lectures (a series of six) were difficult and would not be able to hold the attention of a thousand people, so the number was restricted to five hundred. She also lectured at Bryn Mawr, Radcliffe, Amherst and Vassar Colleges, as well as Princeton University and the University of Chicago. She then set off for the West: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Texas, and California. Jo Alsop, of the New York Herald Tribune, respectfully asked, since she talked so clearly why did [she] not write clearly. To this GS replied simply, I do write clearly. Alsop's question neatly summarizes the dilemma people experienced when meeting the affable and intelligent person responsible for the obscure writings. Witnessing GS's lecture, a student reportedly responded: I was dead against her and I just went to see what she looked like and then she took the door of my mind right off its hinges and now it's wide open. GS went back to Paris enamoured with America." <Universal> .
<BHU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Lecturing in Europe November 1945 GS was invited to lecture at the US Army bases in France, Germany, Austria, and Belgium. At the end of the Second World War, GS and Alice Toklas made friends with a great number of American soldiers who were passing through Culoz. When they finally returned to Paris, the army followed them. Carl Van Vechten wrote to say he had sent the whole American Army... STRAIGHT to 5 rue Christine, the Stein-Toklas residence. The visits with the soldiers brought invitations to speak to the Army mess, and after one such affair fifty soldiers were said to have walked Gertrude and Alice home. Finally, the United States Army asked her to make an official tour of bases in occupied Germany. GS found the experience invigorating, but she was distressed by the soldiers' habit of keeping pin-up girls, like religious icons. They idealized women, but, when they walked the streets of Paris, many of them would be drunk and would leer at and insult almost every woman they met." <Universal> .

<BJH> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Autumn 1893 GS was accepted into the Harvard Annex (soon to become Radcliffe College; now Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard) as a special student. Although GS did not graduate from high school and she lacked the Latin requirements to pass the university's entrance exams, she nevertheless managed to persuade the Academic Board of her serious desire to pursue higher education. She studied English under prize-winning American poet William Vaughn Moody and took courses in psychology with Hugo M\u00FCnsterberg and William James. In James's graduate seminar GS's laboratory work with her classmate, Leon Solomons, resulted in two publications in the Harvard Psychological Review : Normal Motor Automatism (September 1896) and Cultivated Motor Automatism: A Study of Character in Its Relation to Attention (May 1898). When her time at Radcliffe College came to an end, James encouraged Stein to continue work in psychology: to do this she was required to enter medical school. GS's relationship with William James, who taught both psychology and philosophy, was remarkable. On her examination booklet she reportedly wrote, Dear Professor James, I am so sorry but really I do not feel a bit like an examination paper in philosophy today, and James replied: Dear Miss Stein, I understand perfectly how you feel. I often feel like that myself. He awarded her the highest grade in the class Autumn 1897 GS was admitted to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine on probationary status until she obtained her Bachelor's degree from Radcliffe College. In May 1898, after completing a Latin requirement, GS graduated magna cum laude in philosophy from Radcliffe College. She was now fully qualified for admission to Johns Hopkins. Though Johns Hopkins had admitted women since 1882, the learning environment was hostile and alienating for female students. According to biographer Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein's experience of medical school was marked by the sex politics of the time: female students were the targets of denigration by male professors and students alike. GS began to distinguish herself as a woman medical student in response to a remark by an influential professor, William Osler, that Human beings may be divided into three groups, men, women and women physicians. At this time, GS came into contact with an old friend, Claribel Cone, a physician who continued to take courses at Johns Hopkins. Claribel asked Gertrude to give a lecture about the advantage of education for women to a Baltimore women's group. GS cited Charlotte Perkins Gilman's recent Women and Economics, 1898, to argue that without education women were limited to being passive and unequal members of society. She refuted notions that higher education diminished women's femininity and de-sexed them. She concluded that the amelioration of the condition of women depended, to a great extent, on women's social responsibility for our neighbors' suffering. Despite the comfort she found in women's company and counsel, GS found the explicit sexism and anti-Semitism at Johns Hopkins disheartening. Her interest in medical school rapidly waned. She affected an air of apathy and boredom. When a fellow student appealed: Gertrude Gertrude remember the cause of women, GS replied, you don't know what it is to be bored. On 5 June 1901, at a medical school faculty meeting, William Osler moved to withhold the degree of Doctor of Medicine from GS unless she successfully completed a summer course. She declined, commenting, you don't know how little I like pathological psychology and how all medicine bores me." <Universal> .

GS's eldest brother, Michael Stein, sold Daniel's railroad franchise and invested this money in real estate, accumulating enough money to keep them for the rest of their lives if they lived modestly. He gave Bertha, Leo, and Gertrude quarterly allowances, increasing hers when he opened a separate account for her in 1895. For the summer of 1893 Gertrude received only $280, while for the fall of 1897 her allowance was $750. On these allowances she lived comfortably in Paris without working for wages. However, it was not until the publication of The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas in 1933 that she enjoyed a substantial increase in income. This was consolidated by her US lecture tour ( October 1934 - May 1935 ), which earned her $100 per lecture from schools and $250 from clubs. Henceforth, she was able consistently to earn money from her writing career." <Universal> .

To avoid French inheritance taxes, however, she had bequeathed her entire collection of paintings to Allan Stein, who preferred to keep them rather than passing them to Alice.

She was content to be her husband's helpmate and was an indulgent mother to her five children: Michael, Simon, Bertha, Leo, and Gertrude. She doted on her girls, Bertha and Gertrude, knowing that the traditional Jewish emphasis on male rituals and education often eclipsed daughters of the family. In 1878 Amelia began a diary documenting the Steins' daily activities. She died in 1888 of cancer (the disease that would take Gertrude's life fifty-eight years later). Father From 1862 to 1874, Daniel Stein owned and operated a branch of Stein Brothers Clothiers in Pittsburgh with his youngest brother, Solomon. The business was dissolved after years of discord between the brothers. Daniel decided to pursue banking in Austria, but changed his mind and returned to the United States, leaving his wife and children in Vienna for four years. His children lived with a persistent anxiety about their temperamental and unpredictable father. In 1879 Daniel joined his wife and children in Paris and accompanied them back to the United States. He found work as Vice-President of the Omnibus Cable Company and settled in Oakland, California. He died in 1891. Leo Stein GS and Leo Stein, two years her elder, shared an interest in books and learning, though they were competitive, and he repeatedly disagreed with her accounts of her life. When, for instance, she reported that she had written Snatched from Death; or, The Sundered Sisters at the age of eight, Leo insisted that she was closer to fourteen. Leo was markedly less than enthusiastic about her writing: he thought that it was an abomination and that her talent, like Picasso's, was feeble. When they lived together his coldness about her work forced her to write at night. After many years of emotional estrangement and jealousy, Leo Stein moved out of their shared home at 27 rue de Fleurus in 1912. Bertha Stein GS and her older sister Bertha, who, as children, had shared a room, were later indifferent to one another. When their mother died in 1888, household duties suddenly became Bertha's responsibility.

<BQV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Reviewers of GS saw this work as embodying a new naturalism. H. G. Wells read Three Lives with deepening pleasure & admiration, and William James wrote to tell her that it was a fine new kind of realism. Wyndham Lewis, however, launched a vitriolic attack, claiming that Gertrude Stein's prose-song is a cold, black suet-pudding. Melanctha, GS's representation of an African-American character, remains the most controversial of the three pieces. Richard Wright and James Weldon Johnson praised GS for her human depiction of African-American relationships, and Nella Larsen wrote that she had managed to capture the spirit of this race of [hers]. Others, such as Claude McKay, said that her portrayal of black characters lacked authenticity. Three Lives continues to be widely read. Penguin reprinted it in 1990 ; it is printed in the 1998 Library of America edition of Gertrude Stein, Writings 1903-1932." <Universal> .
<BQW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "GS was disappointed at the small enthusiasm the book generated when it was published. Only Marianne Moore reviewed it favourably. Katherine Anne Porter despaired of its length and density, but argued that to shorten it would be to mutilate its vitals, and it is a very necessary book. John Malcolm Brinnin argues that The Making of Americans is, in large part, a story about GS's own family; he compares her style to Marcel Proust's in \u00C0 la recherche du temps perdu. Re-evaluating the novel, critic Richard Bridgman finds that it is mainly an outlet for genius to... make its own unimaginable way. Terry Castle has called it the looming, cloud-capped, mindwarping Everest of the Steinian oeuvre, which is so visually and verbally dense, page by page, with a restricted vocabulary, programmatic syntactical permutations and deadening repetition. Janet Malcolm judges it cathartic, a great outpouring of grief and anger and sorrow and doubt, making a dark, death-ridden book whose reader, because of its difficulty, may feel like an uninvited guest. An abridged version of The Making of Americans was published in 1934; the full version was reprinted in 1966 by Something Else Press in New York." <Universal> .
<BQX> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Alfred Stieglitz, the editor of Camera Work, wrote to tell GS : You have undoubtedly succeeded in expressing Matisse and Picasso in words. Writer and journalist Henri-Pierre Roch\u00E9 saw things differently: he criticized her portraits because of their chaotic abundance and accused her of being very lazy. He felt that her portraits relied on her personality, and without knowing her, he could not see anyone understanding her writings. In response, GS wrote to him: I am a genuinely creative artist and being such my personality determines my art just as Matisse's or Picasso's or Wagner's or anyone else. Now you if I were a man would not write me such a letter because you would respect the inevitable character of my art." <Universal> .
<BQY> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Edith Sitwell reviewed Geography and Plays in 1923, and expressed reservations about its insuperable amount of silliness. A year later, in another review, however, she said that she had read almost nothing else. A representative from Four Seas Press told GS that even if we never succeed in making any great amount of money on this book, we appreciate the value of having your name on our list. Geography and Plays has been reprinted several times, most recently by the University of Wisconsin Press in 1993, with an introduction and annotations by Cyrena N. Pondrom." <Universal> .

<BRA> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "In his introduction to this text, Thornton Wilder wrote that the fundamental preoccupation of Miss Stein's life was not the work of art but the shaping of a theory of knowledge, a theory of time, and a theory of the passions. Bennett Cerf of Random House wrote for the dustjacket: This space is usually reserved for a brief description of a book's contents. In this case, however, I must admit frankly that I do not know what Miss Stein is talking about. I do not even understand the title. I admire Miss Stein tremendously, and I like to publish her books, although most of the time I do not know what she is driving at. Bur in introducing a recent paperback edition William H Gass has called the book philosophically, the most important of her texts." <Universal> .
<BRB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "From the time when the Atlantic Monthly published the first serial instalments of this book, English readers as well as American were enthusiastic, and enthusiasm grew with its appearance as a volume. GS had frequently submitted work to Atlantic Monthly but she was repeatedly turned down by Ellery Sedgwick, who felt that they lived in different worlds. The Autobiography changed his mind. He wrote to her: There has been a lot of pother about this book of yours, but what a delightful book it is.... I think you felt my constant hope that the time would come when the real Miss Stein would pierce the smoke-screen with which she has always so mischievously surrounded herself. The old crowd did not take so well to some of GS's portrayals, including her self-description as a child prodigy, a genius, and the discoverer of modern art. In February 1935, transition, the review that had strongly supported GS's experimental writings in previous years, published responses by those who felt mistreated by the book. Eugene Jolas wrote that these responses invalidate the claim of the Toklas-Stein memorial that Miss Stein was in any way concerned with the shaping of the epoch she attempts to describe. Matisse denied that GS had anything to do with the purchase of Femme au chapeau, and Maria Jolas, co-editor of transition, accused Stein of ingratitude to all those who had helped her in the early years. Braque, who co-invented cubism with Picasso, declared that GS's French was so bad that she could barely take part in conversations: she never went beyond the stage of the tourist. (This remark, obviously spiteful, may also have been untrue: GS claims that on her daily walks she often stopped to converse with locals.) Leo Stein wrote to his friend Mabel Weeks to say that GS was a liar and that her chronology is too wonderful. On a theoretical level, critic Shirley Neuman maintains that The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas was GS's first tentative move towards the meta-autobiography... towards the text as simultaneously a literary theory about the genre and a particularized embodiment of that theory." <Universal> .
<BRC> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Bennett Cerf wrote in 27 March 1945 to tell her about the astounding success of the book: sales were over the 10,000 mark and [t]he $2000.00 that [she] receiv[ed] from Collier's for use of parts of the book [would] be invested in war bonds, in accordance with her request. Terry Castle maintains that in it a few hints of existential distress slip past the self-censorship." <Universal> .
<BRD> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "GS's writing has been ruffling critics since Laura Riding wrote in 1927 of her literalism, simple-mindedness, and successful barbarism. In 1945 Hugh Walpole painted Stein as a self-adoring priestess of her own cult; he was strongly contradicted by Marie Belloc Lowndes. Stein's reputation has remained enigmatic despite the resurgence of interest in her work among feminists and literary theorists. Her abstruse language and internal system of referentiality continues to challenge readers. She is remembered as an innovator in language and a forerunner, of, for instance, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets Nicole Brossard, Charles Bernstein and bpNichol." <Universal> .

GS reported that she and Toklas were on the road to Lyon when the local village doctor told them: Everybody knows you here.... Everybody likes you; we all would help you in every way. Why risk yourself among strangers? They stayed and were cut off from the life they had known before 1939, protected by the people of these little towns\u2014as well as, clandestinely and by his own later admission, by the unsavoury Bernard Fa\u00FF (whose part in this murky period in their lives has been investigated by Janet Malcolm among others). The mayor of Culoz and his Swiss wife kept their names off the official town records. Stein and Toklas had a close call when German soldiers were billeted with them for one night. They stayed out of the way and luckily the soldiers did not notice their American accents or their Picasso paintings. GS wrote Wars I Have Seen during these years. When American soldiers came to Culoz on 1 September 1944, she and Alice were ecstatic. The G.I.s returned the affection, calling her Gerty. From these meetings, GS wrote Brewsie and Willie (1946).

The result, which Picasso gave to Stein, became one of the icons of modernism. n.b. for visual GS and Leo were introduced to the work of the twenty-four-year-old Pablo Picasso at Sagot's Gallery. GS was viewing a prospective purchase, Jeune fille aux fleurs, when Picasso saw her and he immediately wanted to paint her. The two developed a keen mutual understanding and loyalty. In The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, Stein reports that Picasso would say expliquez-moi cela, and the two would converse intensely for hours while her painted her portrait. When Picasso asked Stein to sit for him, he had not worked with a model for eight years. It was a definitive moment for him. Just emerging from his Rose Period, he was about to launch into his mature mode. The Portrait de Gertrude Stein represents the mature form of his work, and belongs to the period of Les demoiselles d'Avignon." <Universal> .

Picasso and his lover Fernande Bellevalle\u00E9 (later Olivier) were hosting a small dinner to hear Rousseau play the violin. The small dinner swelled in size as word-of-mouth circulation made its existence known. But the caterer failed to deliver the food. Fernande and Alice were forced to prepare an impromptu supper while the guests went to a nearby bar to get thoroughly drunk. The dinner soon continued merrily with improvised odes and praise for the guest of honour, who by this time was asleep. The banquet Rousseau exemplified the heroic age of cubism, and a rowdier artistic circle that some, like the more sedate Matisse, did not approve of. In fact, Matisse was puzzled that GS, a woman of quality, could be intimate with Picasso, who was obviously beneath her class." <Universal> .

The trip did not result in a publishing contract, as GS had hoped, but it did advance her reputation. The next year she was visited by Britons such as Lady Cunard and her daughter Nancy, Vanessa and Clive Bell, Lady Ottoline Morrell (who, GS thought, looked like a marvelous feminine version of Disraeli ), Wyndham Lewis, Henry Lamb, Augustus John, the Duchess of Clermont-Tonn\u00E8rre (whose short haircut in 1927 inspired GS to have her own hair cropped like a monk), and Edith Sitwell. Only the year after that did GS finally sign a publishing contract, when she and Alice Toklas travelled to London again to make a deal with John Lane for the publication of Three Lives." <Universal> .

Hemingway had come to Paris as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Daily Star and a feature writer for the Star Weekly. He was referred to GS by their mutual friend Sherwood Anderson, and immediately he found in her a mentor and source of strength. He also felt a strong sexual attraction to her and expressed the desire to lay her. He asked her to be the godmother of his first child in 1923. Hemingway's friendships with both Anderson and Stein were ended in 1925, when he attacked Sherwood Anderson in The Torrents of Spring Over the years, the old crowd had begun to disperse and the Saturday evening salons were frequented more by writers and less by artists. Although GS had published only a few volumes and had often been rejected by publishers, her fame had increased and her salon became legendary for Americans. Some came to her salon with letters of introduction from Sylvia Beach ; some simply came. (When Beach opened her bookshop, Shakespeare and Company, in November 1919, GS was delighted to find there two copies of Tender Buttons. She became one of the first subscribers to the lending library and Beach began sending new people to her salon.) Among the young Americans to attend were Sherwood Anderson, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald (who, GS felt, was the only one at that time of their descent on Paris to have already given proof of a gift ), William Carlos Williams, Kate Buss, Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy (who wrote a poem praising GS as Curie of the laboratory ), H. D., Marsden Hartley and Carl Van Vechten. Natalie Barney, another American expatriate in Paris, did not meet GS until she wrote on 16 December 1926 to invite Stein to read at the Acad\u00E9mie des Femmes, Barney's salon gathering of French, American, and British women writers. (The name explicitly countered the exclusively male Acad\u00E9mie Fran\u00E7aise.) They became fast friends and walked together in the evenings; however, Barney understood little of Stein's writing and felt that Stein avoided the point." <Universal> .

Fay was later imprisoned for collaboration, condemned in 1946 to a life sentence with hard labour. At the end of her life, GS appealed against his conviction.

<EQ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "October 1909 NCB began to host literary gatherings on Friday evenings from five to eight p.m. at 20 rue Jacob in the Faubourg Saint-Germain in Paris. The salon continued for sixty years. Her home at rue Jacob had been acquired in the spring of that year, with the help of her friend, French writer Lucie Delarue-Mardrus. Its garden held a small Doric temple, which became known as the Temple \u00E0 l'Amiti\u00E9. The salon was a fertile meeting ground for American, English, and Continental intellectuals, and a place where writers and artists could try out new work. NCB always insisted that her salon was nothing official, and that no one reigned over it, least of all herself: Je n'ai rien de formel, de rassurant ni de fixe; il se peut qu'un jour l'on ne me trouve m\u00EAme plus \u00E0 mon jour,\u2014J'aurai br\u00FBl\u00E9 mon Temple \u00E0 l'Amiti\u00E9\u2014geste rituel d\u00FB aux amis disparus\u2014ou je l'aurai emport\u00E9 comme un tabernacle vers l'inconnu, avec un sourire complice de tous les horizons. Translation: I have nothing formal, reassuring, or fixed; it could be that one day I will no longer be found there\u2014I will have burned my Temple of Friendship \u2014ritual gesture due to vanished friends\u2014or I will have taken it with me like a tabernacle toward the unknown, with a knowing smile from all horizons." <Universal> .
<ER> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Ezra Pound Ezra Pound, a friend and regular visitor at the salon during and after the interwar years, collaborated with NCB on a couple of unsuccessful literary ventures. Spring 1922 NCB and Ezra Pound formed Bel Esprit, a short-lived patronage scheme which Pound described as a sort of consumers' league to pay for quality rather than quantity in literature and the fine arts. Their goal was to offer financial backing to struggling writers such as T. S. Eliot and Paul Val\u00E9ry, but the venture failed because Eliot was too embarrassed to accept the money, and Val\u00E9ry secured funds from other sources. A few years later, in 1925, Barney approached Pound with her ideas for a new bilingual literary magazine, which she planned to edit with Sinclair Lewis. Pound was discouraging, telling her that he had the STRONGEST objections to writing incidental prose for the journal, and that transatlantic seems to me suffiiciently Inclusive. (Barney was already contributing financially to Ford's transatlantic review.) Acad\u00E9mie des Femmes 7 January 1927 NCB began the Acad\u00E9mie des Femmes, a series of readings and performances at her salon in Paris designed to bring together American, English, and French women writers. In a letter to Gertrude Stein written in December 1926, NCB explains: The other night... I realized how little the French femmes de lettres know of English and Americans and vice versa... I wish I might bring about a better entente, and hope therefore to organize... readings and presentations that will enable our mind-allies to appreciate each other. In Aventures de l'esprit, NCB attributes her inspiration in forming the group to Marie Len\u00E9rue's pacifist-feminist work, Le Temoin (1915). The Acad\u00E9mie des Femmes offered an alternative to the exclusively male Acad\u00E9mie Fran\u00E7aise. Several evenings were conceived as celebrations of particular women writers, including Aurel, Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, Mina Loy, and Colette. 4 February 1927 Gertrude Stein was the featured writer at a gathering of the Acad\u00E9mie des Femmes at NCB's salon. The programme included an introduction by Mina Loy, Barney's French translations of The Making of Americans, and musical settings by Virgil Thomson. 3 June 1927 Rachilde and Ford Madox Ford discussed American women writers at a meeting of the Acad\u00E9mie des Femmes at NCB's salon in Paris, giving special attention to Djuna Barnes. When Barnes herself appeared\u2014one of the younger writers to frequent the salon\u2014 NCB translated one of her stories and several poems into French for the occasion. Some of the introductions NCB wrote for women writers who appeared in her salon are printed in the second part of Aventures de l'esprit." <Universal> .

He helped her escape from some children who were chasing her, and then sat her on his knee and told her a story. She came to see the encounter as a formative experience; an account of their meeting opens Aventures de l'esprit (in which she also recounts writing him a letter in gaol during her adolescent years), and she credits his stories for sparking her own interest in writing." <Universal> .
<KU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "By the 1920s the salon attracted an impressive array of prominent writers, artists, and intellectuals, including Paul Val\u00E9ry, Colette, Jean Cocteau, Gabriele D'Annunzio, Rabindranath Tagore, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Isadora Duncan, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Sylvia Beach, Edna St Vincent Millay, and Ford Madox Ford. The salon's appeal in the interwar years lay mostly with the older generation of writers; some younger writers found it rather outmoded. William Carlos Williams, for instance, conceded that NCB was extremely gracious and no fool to be sure... she could tell a pickle from a clam any day in the week, but found that her salon resembled something preserved in amber from the time of the Renaissance. Barney revived the salon when she returned to Paris from Italy after the Second World War, but by this time it no longer played a central role in the Paris intellectual scene." <Universal> .

Telling her that her book was ravissant et profond et fait honte aux miens, Translation: ravishing and profound and puts mine to shame. (In Aventures de l'esprit NCB notes modestly that the word profound seems to have been added as an afterthought.) he secured an invitiation to her salon, but postponed his visit several times because of illness, and hardly broached the subject of lesbianism when they finally met. Ezra Pound reviewed the book in the October 1921 issue of Dial, writing that NCB had managed to publish with complete mental laziness a book of unfinished sentences and broken paragraphs, which is, on the whole, readable and is interesting as documentary evidence of a specimen [of] liberation. He translated a series of her aphorisms on writers and writing. According to her biographer Jean Chalon, this work, along with the Nouvelles pens\u00E9es d'une Amazone (1939), established NCB's reputation as a writer and not merely an object of curiosity." <Universal> .

She also featured regularly, from the time she was in her mid-twenties, as a fictional character in works written by friends and acquaintances. She appears twice as an attractive young American seductress named Flossie, first in Liane de Pougy's autobiographical novel Idylle saphique ( 1901 ), and then in Colette's Claudine s'en va ( 1903 ). According to Jean Chalon, NCB unknowingly contributed to Pougy's novel, specifically the chapter describing Sarah Bernhardt. In 1904 Barney's lover Ren\u00E9e Vivien wrote a fictionalized treatment of their relationship in her novel Une Femme m'apparut. In 1928 NCB appeared as a character in two works, Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness and Djuna Barnes's Ladies Almanack, and in 1930 she appeared in Lucie Delarue-Mardrus's L'Ange et les pervers. In 1912-13, NCB's fame was bolstered by a series of essays addressed to her by Remy de Gourmont entitled Lettres \u00E0 l'Amazone, published in the Paris literary magazine Mercure de France. Ezra Pound's Cantos pisans also make reference to NCB's salon: The old trees near the Rue Jacob were propped up to keep them from falling \u00E0 L'Amiti\u00E9 and Natalie said to the apache : vous \u00EAtes tres mal \u00E9lev\u00E9" <Universal> .

<WA> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "ML met the itinerant poet-pugilist Arthur Cravan in New York in April 1917 at the Society of Independent Artists Exhibition. This was the year after his boxing-ring career had peaked. Born Fabian Avenarius Lloyd at Lausanne in Switzerland to parents who were English and Anglo-Irish, he was a nephew of Oscar Wilde's wife Constance. He preferred to call himself a nephew of Wilde, whom he never met in life but about whom he wrote a strange fiction of after-death encounter. Like ML, Cravan had lived in Paris. There he had written (in French, deploying enough pseudonyms for a whole stable of contributors), edited, and sold from a wheelbarrow, his review, Maintenant. He referred to his love of alternative identities as my fatal plurality ; ML wrote that he presented an unreality of himself to the world, to distract attention while he made his spiritual getaway. In addition to his literary endeavours, he had held an exhibition of his paintings under the name of Edouard Archinard, and had won the light-heavyweight boxing championship of France by default. He enjoyed a scandalous reputation as a heavy drinker without either permanent residence nor income. Indeed, Cravan himself circulated a tale in which he claimed to have robbed a Swiss jeweller. ML felt that Cravan was not to be trusted, and hid her own jewellery when he visited her. She was taken, however, with his blend of air of a Viking with the repartee of a Victorian charwoman. They fell in love, and his behaviour changed radically once they began their affair. ML noted that in public, Cravan had become civilized\u2014in private, sublime. Cravan had left Europe for the USA to avoid being drafted into the First World War. He met ML in the month that the US entered the war, and he left New York by the beginning of June, though he visited her sporadically over the summer. On September 1, 1917, he departed for Canada. He sent Loy increasingly desperate letters from Boston, then Portland, Maine, then Sydney, Nova Scotia, then St John's, Newfoundland. It seems he was unable to enter Canada legally. In December he was on the US-Mexican, which he crossed on 20 December 1917. instead. In January 1918, ML joined him in Mexico City. 25 January 1918 ML and Arthur Cravan were married in the town hall of Mexico City. She later wrote that they walked out after the ceremony with great strides like conquering giants." <Universal> .
<WB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Cravan apparently said he wished to test the boat, and sailed out in it alone (though at least two other men were to accompany him in flight from Mexico). He did not return. ML, who never saw him again, and who was haunted for the rest of her life by his disappearance, wrote to his mother: There is not the slightest possibility of him disappearing on purpose. She contacted his family in Switzerland in hopes of receiving information that he was alive, but to no avail. In 1920 she searched for him in New York, contacting the American State Department and the British Secret Service. Neither had conclusive information. She may also have returned to Mexico, suspecting that Cravan might be in a prison there. Later rumours of him resurfacing in Paris and New York during the 1920s under the name of Dorian Hope are unlikely though not impossible. ML later remarked that the happiest time of her life was every moment I spent with Arthur Cravan and that the unhappiest was the rest of the time. In a poem to the colossal absentee she wrote: Husband / how secretly you cuckold me with death. Near the end of her life, she would interrupt her conversations, asking, suddenly off topic: Why was I never to find him?" <Universal> .

By March 1920, however, she decided to return to New York, this time leaving all three children in Florence.
