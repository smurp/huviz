<BW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Lady Byron employed a number of governesses to educate the young AAB at their various country homes. From the age of five Ada received full-time instruction in arithmetic, grammar, spelling, reading, music, geography, drawing, and French six days a week. Ada's mother was a strict disciplinarian who awarded prizes for good behaviour and punishments (including being locked in the closet) for failing to study diligently. From a young age Ada was particularly interested in things mechanical, and as an adolescent she was fascinated by flying machines and astronomy. Among her earliest tutors were mathematician Dr William Frend and his daughter Sophia Frend, Dr William King of the Brighton Co-operative Society, and Arabella Lawrence of the Liverpool Co-operative movement." <Universal> .

<CA> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Father Ada's father, the poet Lord Byron, is well known for his transgressive sexual behaviour of various kinds. His marriage to Lady Byron was shortlived: she left him twelve months after their wedding citing (and fostering) rumours of his incestuous affair with his half-sister Augusta Byron Leigh. Byron left England permanently when AAB was four months old; although he never saw her again he regularly enquired of her, sent her gifts, and immortalized her in his poetry. Marguerite, Countess of Blessington reported him as holding his daughter's portrait in his hand and saying, I am told she is clever\u2014I hope not; and, above all, I hope she is not poetical: the price paid for such advantages, if advantages they be, is such as to make me pray that my child may escape them. Mother Ada's mother, Lady Noel Byron, n\u00E9e Anne Isabella (generally called Annabella) Milbanke, was an active philanthropist and had mathematical interests that led Byron to dub her the Princess of Parallelograms. She was a cousin of William Lamb, who later, as Lord Melbourne, became Prime Minister. Lady Byron described her self-control as matching that of a prison governor, and she practised her supervisory talents on her daughter. Their relations were often strained. Ada recorded that after she was harshly reprimanded as a child for asking her mother about her father, she acquired a feeling of dread toward her mother that continued till the day of her death." <Universal> .
<CB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Lord Lovelace 8 July 1835 At the age of nineteen, AAB married William King, who became first Earl of Lovelace in 1838. He was also eighth Baron King and Baron Ockham, and served as Lord Lieutenant of Surrey. With the title came a whirl of social engagements: balls, concerts (including Bellini's Norma ), and meeting Queen Victoria. The domestic and social duties of managing three houses as a countess interfered with Ada's desire to be a professional mathematician. After her death her husband, on receiving a sizeable inheritance from her family, changed his surname to King-Noel Children Ada and William had three children: Byron Noel (1836-62), Anne Isabella Noel (1837-1917), and Ralph Gordon Noel (1839-1906)." <Universal> .
<CC> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Some, including Lady Byron, speculated that Medora was the child of Byron and his half-sister Augusta Byron Leigh. In 1840 Medora found herself and her child abandoned and impoverished in Tours, and Lady Byron felt compelled to rescue her and bring her back to England. It was at this time that Lady Byron finally told Ada of her belief in Byron's incestuous relationship and urged her to come to Paris to meet her new sister. While relations began amicably, financial disputes soon arose and Ada's contact with Medora ceased in 1844." <Universal> .
<CD> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "7 September 1850 In a rare gesture of interest in Byron \u2014the father she had never met\u2014 AAB visited his home, Newstead Abbey. Jealous of the interest her daughter was showing in the man she had worked to demonize, Lady Byron was angered by Ada's visit to Newstead, and relations between the two deteriorated significantly after the visit. Ada appears to have demonstrated increased sympathy for her father after this point and she later decided (against her mother's wishes) to be buried at Newstead beside him." <Universal> .
<CE> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Spring 1851 Unsuccessful in her attempt to use her mathematical skills to generate income from betting on horses, AAB amassed significant debt. Ada's interest in horses had begun in the late 1840s and reached a peak in 1851, when she designed a new betting system and managed to lose \u00A53,200.

Opiates were prescribed as cures for many of these ailments. It has also been speculated that AAB was anorexic, as her weight fluctuated and she was often extremely thin (which, since her husband detested anyone who was fat, presumably pleased him). Both her parents may also have had eating disorders : Byron partook of diets, gruelling exercise, mudbaths, cold plunges, and regular visits to be weighed at the miller's (on the scales used for bags of flour), in an effort to control his tendency to gain weight, and Lady Byron was famous for eating heavily, particularly of meat which she took in quantities exceptionally large even in that carnivorous period, and then hir[ing] a boat so that she could unload her stomach a short distance out at sea." <Universal> .

<M> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The authorship of A Sketch of the Analytical Engine (which had been published as by A.L.L.) was revealed in a review in Athen\u00E6um in 1848. The work garnered a small positive response when it was released, especially from Ada's friends. Her former mathematical advisor, Dr De Morgan, praised the work to Lady Byron and claimed that he had always considered Ada an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first rate eminence, but had kept this evaluation from her on the grounds that the very great tension of mind which [mathematic problems] require is beyond the strength of a woman's power of application. Widespread recognition of what the famed programmer Alan Turing was later to dub the prophetic insight of AAB's Sketch did not occur until the value of Babbage's engine itself was fully realised with the development of computers in the mid twentieth century. Many recent books feature Ada's contribution to computing. Some, including biographer Dorothy Stein, have argued that Ada's mathematical abilities have been overrated and that she could not have written the notes without Babbage's help. More common, however, is enthusiastic acclaim for AAB's Sketch : Therein, a century before its time, is the concept of a general-purpose digital computer, developed to an amazing degree of sophistication." <Universal> .
<N> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The most famous literary response to Ada was penned by her father, Lord Byron, in the opening lines to the Third Canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage : Is thy face like thy mother's, my fair child! Ada! sole daughter of my house and heart? When last I saw thy young blue eyes they smiled And when we parted,\u2014not as now we part, But with a hope.\u2014 AAB has appeared as a central character in numerous literary works ranging from Disraeli's novel Venetia to Arthur C. Clarke's The Ghost from the Grand Banks. A fictionalized Ada stars in William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's The Difference Engine (1991), a historical novel set in an alternative Victorian England which has fully developed and embraced Babbage's engines. She is also featured in the virtual reality film Conceiving Ada (1997, for which filmmaker Lynn Hershman Leeson pioneered the use of digital sets) and is behind the character of Thomasina in Tom Stoppard's play Arcadia (1993). In 1980 the American Department of Defense named a programming language Ada in her honour. AAB also has a significant web presence. The Ada Project, originally located at Yale and an official project of the Association for Computer Machinery's Committee on the Status of Women in Computing, is a clearinghouse for information and resources related to women in computing and is named in her honour. John Fuegi, of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, with his partner Jo Francis, has made a documentary film, They Dreamed Tomorrow, 2000, in the Women of Power series for Flare Productions, which traces the contributions of AAB and Charles Babbage to the pre-history of computing. All this interest led to the naming of an annual Ada Lovelace Day to celebrate women in science. To mark the day in 2009 film-maker and artist Sydney Padua created a daring duo of dauntless crime fighters named Lovelace and Babbage, in a delicious cult-hit webcomic titled 2DGoggles: or The Thrillilng Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage. It gathered a large following on her blog, and led to various spin-offs including plans for a graphic novel." <Universal> .
