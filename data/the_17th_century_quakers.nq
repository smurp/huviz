<BDV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "In this decade, when informers were rife and, says ES, killing a Quaker was to many people no worse than killing a louse, she fell foul of John Story, one of her own sect who was on the side of caution (praying at home rather than gathering together) and who believed (citing Saint Paul ) that women should wash the Dishes, and not go about to Preach. The antagonism between them grew. After spiritual agonies about the burden laid on her to do this, ES testified at a meeting about God's Controversie with the Exalted and High amongst the Professors of Truth : i.e. with Story. He in turn came round to her house to rebuke her. At Bristol ES seems again to have been preaching against Story when she proclaimed woe that Pot that the Scum remains in it, and spoke of leaders who had turned their backs in the day of Battle, and have left their Brethren in the hands of their Enemies. Prison 1683 ES was jailed at Ilchester in Somerset for preaching at Chew Magna (where she lived). religion The priest of the parish, Robert Cross, was a great persecutor who personally hated ES. She was arrested at a Quaker funeral where many Anglicans were present. Although the Lord... made me to tremble, that I could hardly stand on my feet, she managed, by taking hold on a Friend that was near me, to ensure by her words that the officer sent to arrest her trembled in his turn. She was hauled before magistrates, but they let her go. Cross then arrested the entire Quaker congregation, and left them under guard while he spent two hours having dinner. (They cheerfully filled in the time with an impromptu meeting.) They gained some moral advantage when Cross suddenly collapsed and died a few days later; but this did not mitigate their treatment by the local under-sherriff, John Helliar, who was also virulently anti-Quaker. They were threatened and intimidated, and in prison in winter weather they lay on the hard, cold ground ( like a flock of sheep in a pen in a very cold winter ), denied the straw which they would have willingly paid for. When the case came to trial, ES spoke for them all, threatened a judge and bishop with the judgement of God, and got her co-religionists (of whom she says there were eighty, though another estimate was lower) freed with no punishment except a five-shilling fine apiece, which was never collected." <Universal> .

<KU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "In Malta, an island whose Roman Catholicism the Quaker women regarded as idolatrous, they were warned by the British Consul that they ran a risk, if they engaged in missionary activity, of arrest by the Inquisition (of which the local branch answered to Italy, not Spain). Nevertheless, being moved of the Lord and feeling themselves under divine orders, they began informal preaching at the consul's house, visited the sister of the island's governor in her nunnery at her request, and refused to genuflect to the altar at the convent chapel. And the Inquisitors sent for us, and when we came before them, they asked our Names, and the Names of our Husbands, and the Names of our Fathers and Mothers, and how many children we had; and they asked us, Wherefore we came into that Countrey? And we told them, We were the Servants of the living God, and were moved to come and call them to repentance. Further questioning revealed the wide gulf separating Catholic dogma from the women's Quaker faith, particularly their belief in an infallible light within them which they were bound to follow to the disregard of all other authority. They were soon removed from the consul's house to the stiflingly hot prison of the Inquisition. KE went on a fast or hunger strike which, combined with sweating profusely in the heat, must have left her severely dehydrated. Sarah Chevers, as well as their captors, expected her to die, but she recovered after receiving instructions from God to begin eating again. Later, when separated, the two women more than once fasted in unison, each time ending the fast when the Lord told them to. They were repeatedly given commands from their captors which their inner light would not permit them to follow; they were threatened with whipping; they were, much against their will, separated for two whole years, so that the friars could go from one to another thinking to entangle us in our talk \u2014that is, telling each one that the other had cracked and betrayed her. During those years Katharine had neither fire nor candle in that time above two hours. They were never passive even though confined, but pursued unremitting theological argument with their jailors (who often resorted from argument to brainwashing or psychological torture). Building and improvement work on the Inquisition buildings gave them access to senior local officials; they seized every chance for informal preaching, and later made some contacts beyond the prison walls. Accused of witchcraft, they steadfastly refused to convert to Roman Catholicism or to kiss the Cross, but tried instead to convert their captors; they prayed, quoted the Bible and kept their spiritual hope alive. Even their opponents acknowledged the women's charismatic spiritual power. After their relations with the consul deteriorated, Katherine magisterially rebuked him as a condemned person, and stands guilty before God. She urged him to repent, but his lips did quiver, and his belly trembled, and he could scarce stand upon his legs.... The next time we heard of him, he was dead; We could have rejoiced if he had dyed for righteousness sake; for the Lord delighteth not in the death of a sinner. British diplomats were liable to regard the activities of the Quakers abroad as ridiculous, and... capable to bring dishonor to our Nation. They kept busy even apart from their actual resistance: they did knit Stockins, and gave to them that were made serviceable to us, and did make Garments for the poor prisoners, and mended their Clothes. Their threats of God's vengeance on their captors caused at least some anxiety and self-doubt when an explosion nearby was interpreted as divine intervention on their side. Finally negotiations in England brought release some time early in 1663. George Fox's diary records speaking on their behalf in 1661 to Ludovick Stuart, Lord D'Aubigny (a Catholic peer and ordained priest of the Jansenist persuasion, who held high office in both France and England)." <Universal> .

The Society of Friends gave her permission for her journey. Once abroad, she first visited James II in exile in France, to ask his help in delivering a letter to Louis XIV. James offered to pass the letter on, but she insisted on delivering it in person. When admitted to Louis XIV's presence, she refused to believe he was the king until he put on his hat (which others were forbidden to do in front of him). She then asked him to end the war, which was a grief to her heart as a woman and a Christian. This was the one of the Dutch Wars, now generally known as the Nine Years War, in which William III opposed the power of France. It continued for three more years after HB's intervention. When William Sewel came to write his contemporary history of the Quakers, he omitted all mention of HB's journey to speak with the French king, because it seemed such a rash action, although she had both Quaker and official permission. HB's mission to Louis XIV was recorded in Gerard Croese's The General History of the Quakers, published in 1696, but was omitted from William Sewel's The history of the rise, increase, and progress of the Christian people called Quakers (in English in 1722 ).

Chevers, about ten years older than Evans, was also a west-country-woman (from Slaughterford in Wiltshire ), and also married (to a man named Henry Chevers whom she addresses in loving terms similar to those that Evans uses to her husband, and with whom she had an unspecified number of children). She died in 1664, the year after her return from Malta and the same year as KE's husband. Her name is spelled Chevers on her first title-page, but was also given by contemporaries as both Cheevers and Chivers. The former of these two alternatives has been used by some modern scholars." <Universal> .

In organising the Fund she was interested in promoting social cohesion among Quakers as well as relieving hardship. George Fox continued to frequent Swarthmoor, and at the time of the Restoration ( May 1660 ) was arrested there. MF became the principal female organizer of the Quakers, and corresponded with all the other major figures. In 1653 she had thirty itinerant preachers reporting to her, in 1654 twice that many. She often visited London on business for the Friends, acting as a watchdog for the Society's interests in approaching and parleying with a series of heads of state: Cromwell, Charles II, James II, and William III. 18 February 1653 MF wrote to ask her first husband to arrange the publication of tracts by George Fox and others. In May 1657 she was approached for advice and help by the Levellers John Lilburne. According to one story Lilburne became a Quaker before he died later that year; he was certainly attracted to the Friends and their way of life. The New King 22 June 1660 MF first visited London and presented the earliest formal Quaker peace testimony to Charles II, whom she went on to visit several times more. This approach to the newly-restored monarch was a vital tactical move for the Quakers, who had been persecuted in the last years of the Interregnum. George Fox was still in prison; MF went to London and offered up her life to the King to stand as a pledge for the peace and quietness of all Friends and for their faith. After the Fifth Monarchy revolt of January 1661 and the Royal Proclamation of the same month against holding meetings, she went again to explain to the king what were the consequences of these events and showed him that we were a peaceable innocent people who should be allowed to hold their harmless meetings as before. She and a man named Thomas Moore went repeatedly to the king about the thousands of Quakers in prison, and found him tender towards them. First Imprisonment Early in 1664 A Colonel Richard Kirkby delivered a warning through George Fox to MF that she must cease holding great meetings at her house for they met contrary to the Act. Soon after this Fox was arrested again and MF accompanied him to his trial at Holker Hall. February 1664-June 1668 Arrested in her turn at Holker, MF was imprisoned in Lancaster Castle for her Quaker activism. For refusing to take the customary oath to the king, MF was publicly tried again in August 1664 along with George Fox, to considerable public interest and at least one pamphlet. Biographer Bonnelyn Young Kunze depicts her on trial at the local assizes, with a stool and cushion specially placed for her, and four daughters in attendance. She was, however, condemned by the statute praemunire, which meant the confiscation of her estates by the Crown, with imprisonment at the king's pleasure (i.e. indefinitely). In late 1667 she got permission to leave prison for long enough to attend a meeting which Fox, released, was holding in Cheshire." <Universal> .
<QW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "April 1670 MF was a second time imprisoned at Lancaster for her Quaker work. There was suspicion that her arrest was brought about by her son, who was in legal combat with her for the possession of Swarthmoor. As soon as the persecution ceased, George Fox got two women, Martha Fisher and Hannah Stringer, to go to London to the king to get MF released. In April 1671 a royal discharge let her out, and she came up to London a free woman. This was just before George Fox's two-year visit to America. His incarceration at Worcester, from December 1673 to February 1675, during which he became dangerously ill and she lobbied the king and the Lord Chancellor for him, was probably the severest prison experience of either of them." <Universal> .
<QX> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "September 1683 MF was arrested again, with her youngest daughter, Rachel, and her son-in-law of six months, Daniel Abraham. They were imprisoned, and nine months later heavily fined. MF wrote, they did not fine the house as his [Fox's], he being absent, but fined it as mine. They took a total of eighty pounds from her: for holding the meetings, and for a first and a second offence of speaking. They took 30 head of cattle from me. Their intentions were to ruin us. Following the death of Charles II, a decade after MF had last spoken with him, she had an interview with James II in February 1685 ; she later sent an admonitory letter to William III." <Universal> .

<VB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Children MF had eight daughters (one of whom died young) and one son, born between about 1633 and October 1653. Thomas Fell died in early October 1658. MF enjoyed very close relationships with her daughters. They were well educated at home, whereas their brother went away to school. Several of MF's daughters became Quaker leaders, most notably those whose married names were Isabel Yeamans, Sarah Meade, and Rachel Abraham. Between 1660 and 1691 they all married, choosing their mates for themselves. The daughter who was called Margaret after her mother also worked in the Quaker movement. MF's relations with her extended family were often referred to as a model for the mother in Israel. MF's son, unlike her daughters, was a constant source of unhappiness to her: first by disapproving her second marriage on the grounds that George Fox was her social inferior, and then by engaging in legal battles over property. When he died he bequeathed Swarthmoor Hall (where she was still living) to his infant son. MF retaliated by bequeathing her Quaker grandchildren twice as much as her Fell grandchildren." <Universal> .

<VD> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "27 October 1669 After eleven years of widowhood, MF was married at Bristol to George Fox, with whom she had already been a fellow-worker for years. Phyllis Mack apparently gives the date in Old Style, as 18 October. He was ten years younger than she was; the marriage improved his social standing. The marriage was to some extent disputed within the Quaker movement, though they may have hoped it would quell any possible scandal about their close association. George Fox informed all the meetings in England about it and they all professed themselves satisfied. He also asked MF's children whether they were satisfied and whether they felt she had fulfilled her obligations under her first husband's will. And the children made answer and said she had doubled it, and would not have me speak of those things. Though they spent a week or two together after the wedding, they continued to live apart and to travel independently for many years after their marriage. Fox's last visit to Swarthmoor took place in 1678, years before his death. Their relationship was used in the Quaker movement as an emblem of the spiritual unity of Adam and Eve before the Fall. George Fox wrote to MF as Dear Heart, a phrase she had used to him almost since they first met, and also to her first husband. Francis Bugg (who harrassed another Quaker writer, Anne Docwra, with slanderous writings) later published a mocking story that George Fox and MF thought God had intervened to make her pregnant at her advanced age, that they prepared for a birth and were disappointed." <Universal> .
