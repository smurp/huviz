The conservative journal kept up regular attacks on her for a decade, often in terms she considered insolently personal. HM was told that the vicious 1833 review of the Illustrations of Political Economy in the Quarterly, which was attributed to and originally penned by George Poulett Scrope, was significantly leavened with ribaldry by editors Croker and John Gibson Lockhart in an attempt to destroy her. The review pronounced it impossible not to laugh at the absurd trash which is seriously propounded by some of her characters, in dull didactic dialogues, introduced here and there in the most clumsy manner; and what is worst of all, it is quite impossible not to be shocked, nay disgusted, with many of the unfeminine and mischievous doctrines on the principles of social welfare, of which these tales are made the vehicle. This poisonous review shrilly condemns HM as a traitor to her gender: a female Malthus ian. A woman who thinks child-bearing a crime against society! An unmarried woman who declaims against marriage!! A young woman who deprecates charity and a provision for the poor!!! The review advised her to burn her own books." <Universal> .

The same review, however, contains some adverse comment on other works by HM. With reference to Eastern Life and Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development it remarked that she was at all times an unsafe, and, frequently, a most dangerous guide, being unhappily indifferent to the truth of revelation (that is, to the Bible ).

<BLW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "James Martineau published a scathing attack on the book in the Prospective Review under the title Mesmeric Atheism. He poured scorn on the authors for believing that one can legitimately reach the doctrines of Atheism and annihilation on the basis of data of cerebral physiology and animal magnetism. He characterised Atkinson's style as a rhetorical dilution of Robert Owen and complained that its tiresome propositions, scattered by some process of logical explosion, and wildly lying about without any semblance of cohesion, constitute the theoretic elements of this work. Even by Victorian standards, this was a harsh review, and the reviewer's sister was not spared. With grief we must say that we remember nothing in literary history more melancholy than that Harriet Martineau should be prostrated at the feet of such a master; should lay down at his bidding her early faith in moral obligation, in the living God, in the immortal sanctities; should glory in the infection of his blind arrogance and scorn, mistaking them for wisdom and pity; and meekly undertake to teach him grammar in return.

The final lesson Miller took from her life was advice to women to do something. Her purse and her pen alike were ever ready to aid women's causes; but far more than these could do she has done by her whole life's work. Miller also published a longer biography of HM in the Eminent Women series in 1884, which seeks to fill in some of the gaps between the completion of the Autobiography and her death." <Universal> .

Her eldest sister, Elizabeth, taught her French, Thomas taught her Latin, and Henry taught her mathematics and writing. Although practical jokes and name-calling played a part in this education, it did allow the young writer to gain a broad foundation of knowledge. Latin, for example, was not usually taught to girls but her parents, she remembered, with no prospect of being able to provide dowries, pinched themselves in luxuries to provide their girls, as well as their boys, with masters and schooling. She considered her musical education to be wasted upon her, and she stopped studying music when she lost her hearing. Part of her early education was rote learning: she remembered vividly the impact upon her of learning by heart Mrs Barbauld's Prose Hymns. She also looked back with pride on her ability in household accomplishments such as sewing as well as literary employments. 1813-1815 HM received the unexpected opportunity to study at the Rev. Isaac Perry's School in her home town of Norwich. While there she discovered her hearing impairment. Perry had lost most of his male pupils when he converted to Unitarianism. Though the room and curriculum were shared, the boys and girls were separated and unable to see or communicate with one another. Harriet was the youngest of fourteen girls in the school, where she continued to learn Latin, French, composition, and arithmetic along with the male students.During this period of her life she heard the abolitionist William Wilberforce lecture." <Universal> .

Lant Carpenter. Apparently, HM's family sent her to Bristol without informing her that she would be gone for such a long period. In Mrs Rankin, whom she refers to in her Autobiography as her Aunt Kentish, she says she found for the first time, a human being whom I was not afraid of. Her peers found her conscientious and clever, if somewhat sombre. She recalled enjoying the study of logic, rhetoric, history, and poetry. Carpenter introduced her to John Locke's essays, and induced in her, by her own account, a superstitious religious fanaticism." <Universal> .

<BNH> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "HM depicts herself as both flummoxed and thrilled when her revered brother Thomas praised this essay highly without knowing of her authorship. When she revealed it, he counselled her: Now, dear, leave it to other women to make shirts and darn stockings; and do you devote yourself to this. She recalled: That evening made me an authoress. She also in her Autobiography linked her vocation to her single status and a sense of unfitness for domestic life: The older I have grown, the more serious and irremediable have seemed to me the evils and disadvantages of married life, as it exists among us at this time.... My business in life has been to think and learn, and to speak out with absolute freedom what I have thought and learned.... The simplicity and independence of this vocation first suited my infirm and ill-developed nature, and then sufficed for my needs, together with family ties and domestic duties, such as I have been blessed with, and as every woman's heart requires." <Universal> .

<BNJ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "It so impressed the lace-makers of Derby and Nottingham that they asked for another story from her on the subject of wages. Maria Weston Chapman saw these stories as a new kind of fiction, the first examples of a new application of the modern novel. To the biographical and the philosophical novel, the descriptive and the historical novel, the romantic and the domestic novel, the fashionable and the religious novel, and the novel of society, was now to be added the humanitarian or novel of social reform." <Universal> .
<BNK> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "HM later dated her release from pecuniary care from the huge, immediate success of this first number. The Athen\u00E6um, after hedging its bets for half of its brief paragraph, calling Martineau unimaginative and utilitarian, albeit sensible, conceded that her present project would be popular, since the stories were extremely interesting, whether or not their readers were likely to learn from them. Mary Russell Mitford commented, I like the first,\" Life in the Wilds,\" best: it is very interesting and Robinson Crusoe -ish; but I am afraid that they are rather too wise for me. I have an old aversion to do-me-good books in general, and to political economy in particular\u2014perhaps because I don't understand it." <Universal> .
<BNL> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Athen\u00E6um expressed enthusiasm about this story and Brooke and Brooke Farm, saying that the tales in Illustrations of Political Economy have more merit than some works of double the size and ten times the pretensions, and that unlike many women HM never laps[ed] into the deadly sin of sentimentality. This tale may have contributed to the passage of the act abolishing slavery, which came into effect on 1 August 1834. According to Ferguson, the principles summarized at the end of the tale served as a blueprint for the consolidation of post-slavery colonial power." <Universal> .
<BNM> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Political economy was controversial in itself, and the potentially scandalous exposition by a young unmarried female of matters having to do with population control provided grist for the mills of hostile reviewers. HM recollected hearing that John Wilson Croker of the Quarterly had boasted of tomahawking Miss Martineau. The conservative journal kept up regular attacks on her for a decade, often in terms she considered insolently personal. HM was told that the vicious 1833 review of the Illustrations of Political Economy in the Quarterly, which was attributed to and originally penned by George Poulett Scrope, was significantly leavened with ribaldry by editors Croker and John Gibson Lockhart in an attempt to destroy her. The review pronounced it impossible not to laugh at the absurd trash which is seriously propounded by some of her characters, in dull didactic dialogues, introduced here and there in the most clumsy manner; and what is worst of all, it is quite impossible not to be shocked, nay disgusted, with many of the unfeminine and mischievous doctrines on the principles of social welfare, of which these tales are made the vehicle. This poisonous review shrilly condemns HM as a traitor to her gender: a female Malthus ian. A woman who thinks child-bearing a crime against society! An unmarried woman who declaims against marriage!! A young woman who deprecates charity and a provision for the poor!!! The review advised her to burn her own books. Sales increased, however, following this negative publicity, in weathering which she felt herself strengthened." <Universal> .
<BNN> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "P. J. Keating discusses this tale in The Working Classes in Victorian Fiction, 1971." <Universal> .
<BNO> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Athen\u00E6um called HM always natural, lively, and dramatic, and supposed that many readers might never suspect her didactic purpose. By this tale, HM claimed, Elizabeth Fry and her brother J. J. Gurney were convinced that they had for years been unsuspectingly doing mischief where they meant to do good and that the poor would be benefited by sweeping changes in the poor laws." <Universal> .
<BNP> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Illustrations catapulted HM into fame: she was lionized by London society. She received flattering responses from Coleridge and from her precursor as a political economist, Jane Marcet. Christian Isobel Johnstone in Tait's Edinburgh Magazine (which she edited, and to which HM soon began contributing) gave the series fulsome praise, arguing that there is something in the female mind which peculiarly fits it for elucidating, in a familiar manner, the intricacies of political economy. The economy of empires is only the economy of families and neighbourhoods on a larger scale. Now woman is eminently the best family manager. After scrupulously avoiding meeting HM (he would leave a room if she entered it) in order to avoid allegations of personal favour, William Empson published a lead notice in the April 1833 Edinburgh Review, placing the first thirteen numbers of the series alongside another book on the same subject by Marcet. He came to terms with the author's sex in a somewhat tortured manner: Women might, and it was becoming they should, protect and comfort the poor; political economy has an immediate connection with this; therefore a woman may be a political economist without being supposed to have abated any natural and right horror of Amazons in politics. HM considered this review extraordinarily laudatory and appreciated its analysis, but she disagreed with it on several points relating to social morality. Overall she thought the praise did not seem... to be very rational and sound. She also claimed that the Edinburgh's reputation as an instrument of the Whigs meant that its positive review of her series was bad for sales, making readers assume (unwarrantedly, in her view) that she was a pet of the Liberal Party. Guizot, the French Minister of Public Instruction, was ordered by Louis Philippe to translate the Illustrations for the French national schools. He considered HM to be the only woman ever to have affected legislation directly (that is, not through a man). The Royal Jennerian Society, chaired by the Duke of Wellington, unanimously voted HM a member, believing her writing might help promote the cause of vaccination. Maria Weston Chapman viewed the books in this series as an innovation in literary terms, and also as the beginnings in England of a science of sociology. Some, such as Sara Coleridge, lamented this latter emphasis, which she thought detracted from their literary value." <Universal> .
<BNQ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Undertaken at the urging of John Bright, who supplied HM with evidence collected for his Parliament ary committee, this venture was not well-received and brought her no money." <Universal> .
<BNR> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "August 1841 HM was offered a Civil List pension by the Whig government, which she refused on principle. She wanted to maintain her independence from all influence; her letter declining this honour expressed her belief that it would be wrong to accept income from an unjust tax system that injured the working poor. She had made up her mind to accept a mooted pension in 1832, but it never materialised and she came to feel that her independence of mind was too precious to accept such an obligation. Lady Byron was so pleased by this that she gave HM a gift of \u00A5100, which was accepted, as was the annuity raised by a private Testimonial for her benefit. HM's position infuriated Lord Brougham, who exclaimed: Harriet Martineau! I hate her! I hate a woman who has opinions. She has refused a pension,\u2014making herself out to be better than other people. She refused another state pension in 1873." <Universal> .
<BNS> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "While the book lacks, according to the lead review in the Athen\u00E6um, all the charm of a personal narrative, all the attraction of continuous adventure, and of that glitter of proper names to which the literary men of the present day have accustomed the public, Society in America honestly confronts the faults which HM sees in Americans in such a way that her objections to Americans as they are, flow immediately from her high estimate of what they may and will be." <Universal> .
<BNT> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Margaret Fuller considered this a hasty book, although HM claimed that it took three years to write. Critic Susan Hoecker-Drysdale, on the other hand, judges it to be among the most thorough sociological studies of a society in the nineteenth century." <Universal> .
<BNU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Although the book's goal of teaching others to observe was challenged, the Athen\u00E6um pronounced it, in a lead review, a production of great merit, replete with sound reflections. More recently, critic Alexis Easley has argued that by providing readers with the tools to analyze other cultures\u2014and their own\u2014from a gender-sensitive perspective, HM fostered a feminist consciousness among middle-class readers, encouraging them to view gender roles as categories generated by a given set of institutional arrangements, rather than as natural, God-given identities. Resistance to this perspective within the emergent discipline may have been in part responsible for the disappearance of this should-be-classic from the annals of sociological history." <Universal> .
<BNV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Comte himself was so impressed by her work that he had it translated into French and substituted for his own original in the Positivist Library, his personal selection of the 270 great books worthy of prescribed reading for the proletariat. The estimate of Frederic Harrison, Comte's leading disciple in England, was less enthusiastic, as his introduction to the 1896 edition made evident. In 2001 the publication of Michael R. Hill and Susan Hoecker-Drysdale's Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives marked a recent shift within the field of sociology to take Harriet Martineau seriously as a major and consequential intellect." <Universal> .
<BNW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Athen\u00E6um compared this novel favourably to the work of Jane Austen, saying that HM outstripped her predecessor in creating characters of a higher order of mental force and spiritual attainment, and offering to the middle classes pleasure which opens, elevates, and humanizes the mind. It judged the dialogue to be poor, however, and some characters over-idealised. The Edinburgh Review also compared Martineau to Austen, but was less positive. Considering the setting narrow, the events few, tame and trite, and the middle class most unromantic and unpicturesque, it warned HM not to expect popularity. The Blackwood's review led off with a highly critical assessment of her writings and her radical opinions, including what it understood as her claim to sexual equality, but it praised the novel strongly, saying she had approached Austen and produced an analysis of the affections worthy of Madame De Sta\u00EBl, with a picture of female purity and goodness far nobler and simpler than Corinne. This review pointed out with some glee what was regarded as flawed accounting in the representation of the Hope family's financial woe, but concluded by congratulating the author for resisting the prevailing fad for Byron ic heroes and offering a wholesome domestic tale of middle-class life. The novel prompted a complimentary letter on 7 November 1849 from Currer Bell ( Charlotte Bront\u00EB ) saying that in it he tasted a new and keen pleasure, and experienced a genuine benefit. In his mind, Deerbrook ranks with the writings that have really done him good, added to his stock of ideas, and rectified his views of life. The letter came with a copy of Shirley. Having already concluded from her reading of Jane Eyre (which she felt uncannily reflected her experience of childhood) that Bell must be a woman, HM addressed her reply, Madam. George Eliot's Middlemarch is indebted to Deerbrook in its handling of a young doctor confronting prejudice in a provincial town after casting a public vote, the workings of gossip, and the problems of an ill-advised marriage to a man of noble character. So is the fiction of Elizabeth Gaskell. Modern critics such as John Sutherland have been harsher in their assessments than the book deserves." <Universal> .
<BNX> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Maria Edgeworth wrote to HM to express her admiration of The Hour and the Man, and Florence Nightingale said after the author's death that she had read it repeatedly and considered it the finest historical romance in any language. The overall reception of this novel was better than that of Deerbrook, although the nobility of the hero was felt to be exaggerated. The Athen\u00E6um was downright hostile to the book's subject: Do the negro justice, we say, by all means; but keep him, for half a century at least, out of our imaginative literature. This review found the book more accurate than most historical romances but felt that it fell short of success as fiction because the dialogue generally weak and the character and speech of the hero were unbelievable given his debased background as a slave. The anxiety the novel aroused in its readers was heightened by the way it mapped easily onto local political struggles. As Christian Isobel Johnstone noted in reviewing it for Tait's, St Domingo (Haiti) contained the pure aristocrats, or whites ; the ten-pound voters, or mulattoes ; and the chartists, those who claim the suffrage, or negroes. Recent scholar Caroline Roberts reads The Hour and the Man as a response to HM's earlier critique of Scott's historical romances, and as a conscious engagement with the problems of reading and representing history. In the obituary she composed for herself, HM wrote: none of her novels or tales have, or ever had, in the eyes of good judges or in her own, any character of permanence." <Universal> .
<BNY> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Life in the Sick-Room sold well, and HM was paid \u00A5125 by Moxon for it. Samuel Smiles in 1883 considered it one of her most delightful books. In later years, HM was led by what she felt to be a moaning undertone to heartily despise a considerable part of the book." <Universal> .
<BNZ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Athen\u00E6um's editor, Charles Wentworth Dilke, commissioned a reply that was attributed to the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie. The response argued that HM was both hysterical and insufficiently expert to judge of the success of her treatment. The British and Foreign Medical Review and the London Medical Gazette supported the position taken by this reply. Then Thomas Michael Greenhow, HM's doctor, weighed in with a shilling pamphlet, Medical Report of the Case of Miss H\u2014\u2014\u2014M\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014, 1845. This enraged his patient, who claimed she had authorized him only to divulge details of her case in the usual form to the medical community, not to the public at large in plain English. Caroline Frances Cornwallis wrote to a friend: The whole affair bears so much the aspect of imposture that I cannot think how she can hazard her fame by sending forth such statements." <Universal> .

<BOA> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Mary Russell Mitford wrote disapprovingly of HM's claims: I see no good in these experiments. Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna's pamphlet Mesmerism: A Letter to Miss Martineau, argued that if the account given was not a fraud, then the agency involved was most assuredly diabolical. She begged HM to devote herself to prayer and desist from spreading such accounts. But others were more sympathetic. Elizabeth Barrett Browning argued to Mary Russell Mitford that to speak the truth as she apprehends it, at such a cost, & to bear the penalty so highheartedly, does strike me as worthy of Harriet Martineau, & of all our admirations. A cousin who was tempted by HM's account to experiment with mesmeric practice was cautioned by Charles Darwin that a tendency to deceive is characteristic of disordered females. Among the more sympathetic published responses was one in Chambers's Edinburgh Journal. Horace or Horatio Smith's novel Love and Mesmerism, 1845, draws significantly on HM and her story, as does Fredrika Bremer's Brothers and Sisters, A Tale of Domestic Life (translated by Mary Howitt in 1848), which Martineau said caused her to blush for its treatment of socialism, mesmerism, and related topics." <Universal> .
<BOB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "HM liked this the best of all her works. Its reception by others was predictably mixed. In the Unitarian Prospective Review, John James Tayler praised its descriptive eloquence, noted the strong censure it had aroused ( we have seen the young solemnly warned from her pages as a tainted region that would strike an insidious poison into their hearts ), and related how one clergyman had burned each page after reading it. Tayler maintained that on the contrary its belief in the universal diffusion of the religious principle in man was deeply reverent. Despite some quibbles about her content and expression, Tayler contended that HM's stance was a Christian one. A shorter and more patronising review by George Croly in Blackwood's began by distinguishing HM from our horror... the professional tourist; the woman who runs abroad to forage for publication; reimports her baggage, bursting with a periodical gathering of nonsense; and with a freight of folly, at once empty as air and heavy as lead, discharges the whole at the heads of a suffering people. He dubs Martineau, however, lady-president of the gossip school, praising her descriptive ability highly but utterly dismissing her allegedly weak and misguided lucubrations on what she calls Bibliolatry. The charming but finally unsympathetic Fraser's review, Fuss in a Book-Club, charts, from the point of view of a copy of the book itself, its progress through a country book-club. Although read seriously and appreciated by some of its female readers, it is judged overall to be undermining Christian faith and is banished (as wicked Socinian trash ) to the study of a student in G\u00F6ttingen. The book-club replaces it with a copy of Agnes and Elizabeth Strickland's Lives of the Queens of England." <Universal> .
<BOC> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "This book resulted in public outcry. Douglas Jerrold responded with wit: There is no God, and Harriet Martineau is his Prophet. Mary Howitt came to regret her contribution to the most awful book that was ever written by a woman. George Eliot, reviewing for The Leader, expressed admiration for the authors' courage but declared (adopting the stance of agnosticism) their opinions to be untenable. J. A. Froude, in a sustained and serious analysis in Fraser's, found the scattered and undisciplined form in which the ideas were presented inadequate to the gravity of the book's claims, and its argument weak and flawed. James Martineau published a scathing attack on the book in the Prospective Review under the title Mesmeric Atheism. He poured scorn on the authors for believing that one can legitimately reach the doctrines of Atheism and annihilation on the basis of data of cerebral physiology and animal magnetism. He characterised Atkinson's style as a rhetorical dilution of Robert Owen and complained that its tiresome propositions, scattered by some process of logical explosion, and wildly lying about without any semblance of cohesion, constitute the theoretic elements of this work. Even by Victorian standards, this was a harsh review, and the reviewer's sister was not spared. With grief we must say that we remember nothing in literary history more melancholy than that Harriet Martineau should be prostrated at the feet of such a master; should lay down at his bidding her early faith in moral obligation, in the living God, in the immortal sanctities; should glory in the infection of his blind arrogance and scorn, mistaking them for wisdom and pity; and meekly undertake to teach him grammar in return. Surely this humiliating inversion of the natural order of nobleness cannot last. HM represented the social consequences of this publication as less painful than she had anticipated, although her Autobiography masks certain facts: for instance, that Charles Knight, who had requested her to extend her successful The History of England During the Thirty Years' Peace: 1816-1846, backed out of this project\u2014in a public advertisement\u2014after the appearance of Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development." <Universal> .
<BOD> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "This prompted Dickens to proclaim there never was such a wrong-headed woman born\u2014such a vain one\u2014or such a Humbug. The Athen\u00E6um reviewed the pamphlet harshly as an offence against taste and modesty, chastising HM for setting herself up as Madame Oracle. It undercut her criticism of Dickens on the grounds that she herself had first arrested social evils as subjects for Art in the Illustrations of Political Economy." <Universal> .
<BOE> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "HM was highly regarded by many other women writers of her day. Elizabeth Barrett Browning pronounced her the most manlike woman in the three kingdoms (that is, in England, Scotland, and Ireland ) in the best sense of man\u2014a woman gifted with admirable fortitude, as well as exercised in high logic\u2014a woman of sensibility & of imagination, certainly, but apt to carry her reason unbent wherever she sets her foot\u2014given to utilitarian philosophy & the habit of logical analysis,\u2014 & suffering under a disease which... [has] yielded to no tried remedy! Eliza Lynn Linton judged her to be a leading light for those inclined to insurgency and speculative freedom. Even during Martineau's lifetime her reputation led young men to name race-horses after her, as if her name augured success. Feminist Florence Fenwick Miller, in a Sunday lecture in the year following HM's death, represented her as one of the shining lights of our time, whose life was one of the most remarkable ever led by a woman, since she was a political power in our land not through birth or influence but by right of her own accomplishments. The final lesson Miller took from her life was advice to women to do something. Her purse and her pen alike were ever ready to aid women's causes; but far more than these could do she has done by her whole life's work. Miller also published a longer biography of HM in the Eminent Women series in 1884, which seeks to fill in some of the gaps between the completion of the Autobiography and her death. Gertrude Townshend Mayer wrote on her in Women of Letters in 1894. John Cranstoun Nevill's brief and somewhat patronising study, 1943, refers to her as Harriet throughout. R. K. Webb's Harriet Martineau: A Radical Victorian, 1960, gives serious attention to her intellectual and political affiliations (though he too is often patronising). Valerie Kossew Pichanick wrote an account of HM's life and work in 1980, as did Gillian Thomas, 1985. Valerie Sanders's Reason Over Passion, 1986, was the first major study of her impact on Victorian fiction, and Deirdre David considered her relation to patriarchy a year later, stressing her ambiguous relationship to masculine authority and her self-construction as an intellectual daughter. Shelagh Hunter historicised HM's work as poetic moralism, looking at her texts in light of her life and the Autobiography, and Claudia Ora\u01FDem in 1999 examined the work on political economy. Deborah Anna Logan's The Hour and the Woman: Harriet Martineau's\"Somewhat Remarkable\" Life, 2002, aimed to restore HM to history as a literary grandmother and major voice of her day, with the most sustained investigation to date of her vexed relationship to feminism. Logan followed this with Harriet Martineau, Victorian Imperialism, and the Civilizing Mission, 2009, which argues Martineau's importance as a commentator on empire. Caroline Roberts's The Woman and the Hour: Harriet Martineau and Victorian Ideologies, 2002, is a historicised study of seven major texts in the context of their initial reception. In addition to this harvest of criticism, rising interest in HM has produced teaching editions of two of her texts\u2014 Life in the Sick-Room and Illustrations of Political Economy: Selected Tales (a sampling from the range of Illustrations )\u2014from Broadview Press. A one-day conference devoted to Martineau's work was held in London in April 2007." <Universal> .

When it came under the editorship of W. J. Fox (between 1827 and 1831 ) she increased the frequency of her contributions. Through Fox she received an apprenticeship that she claimed was more valuable than money: his editorial correspondence with me was unquestionably the occasion, and in great measure the cause, of the greatest intellectual progress I ever made before the age of thirty. For him as editor she wrote several dozen articles. After a while she was sometimes paid occasionally, which, as scholar Francis E. Mineka notes, seems to have given her the significant status of the journal's only paid correspondent." <Universal> .

She worked towards political stability during the Chartist fervour of April 1848 by contributing to a government-sponsored periodical managed by Charles Knight, The Voice of the People. This enterprise (which indeed failed after only two issues) was doomed, in her view, by the controlling hand of the Whig officials, who proposed to lecture to the working-classes, who were by far the wiser party of the two, in a jejune, coaxing, dull, religious-tract sort of tone." <Universal> .

Among the stories she contributed were Woodruffe the Gardener, The People of Bleaburn, a fable entitled The Marsh Fog and the Sea Breeze and, later, full, but picturesque account[s] of manufactures and other productive processes... for instruction and entertainment. She also contributed occasional articles to the Westminster Review, and a series of sketches to the inaugural issues of The Leader. The latter were later published as Sketches from Life, 1856, with illustrations, and were reviewed by Geraldine Jewsbury in 1857 for the Athen\u00E6um. Other journals in which HM's work appeared in later years were Macmillan's Magazine, the Cornhill Magazine, Once a Week, and the US Atlantic Monthly. She signed her contributions to The People's Journal and Once a Week as From the Mountain, which sounds like a reference to the Lettres \u00E9crites de la montagne, published by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in 1764\u2014and therefore like a claim be writing sage discourse." <Universal> .

She told her parents nothing of the terrors and panics that oppressed her, and she wrote later: It seems to me now that a little closer observation would have shown them the causes of the bad health and fitful temper which gave them so much anxiety on my account; and I am sure that a little more of the cheerful tenderness which was in those days thought bad for children, would have saved me from my worst faults, and from a world of suffering. She felt that her temper was irreparably ruined by the severe and often unjust treatment she received from adults and the older children in her family. I was abundantly obedient in act... but the interior rebellion kept my conscience in a state of perpetual torture. She remembered intense jealousy of other children and a fierce love of money." <Universal> .
<BUT> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "1818 By the time HM was sixteen, her deafness was pronounced enough to cause her considerable social distress. She was also impaired in the ability to taste and smell, and considered the deficiency of three senses out of five a source of fatigue as well as privation. But she felt in later life that her deafness might have been the best thing that ever happened to [her]... as the grandest impulse to self-mastery; and... as [her] most peculiar opportunity of helping others, who suffer the same misfortune." <Universal> .
<BUU> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "1830 After struggling with her deafness for over a decade, HM finally resorted to the use of an ear trumpet. Nathaniel Hawthorne, who visited her in later years, described her as the most continual talker I ever heard; it is really like the babbling of a brook, and very lively and sensible too; and all the while she talks she moves the bowl of her ear-trumpet from one auditor to another, so that it becomes quite an organ of intelligence and sympathy between her and yourself. Fascinated by the sensitivity of her appeals for response, he says they were made by plying the trumpet as though it were the delicate antenna of an insect." <Universal> .
<BUV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Fruits of Success Under the strain of planning, negotiating terms for, and writing a new number of Illustrations of Political Economy each month, HM's health suffered and she was at times quite ill.

<BUW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "She had a difficult journey home. Her brother James accompanied her, and several friends\u2014 Julia Smith (also an abolitionist and the aunt of Florence Nightingale ), who had been her travelling companion along with her cousin Isabella Rankin (the daughter of HM's Aunt Kentish ), and Elisabeth Jesser Reid \u2014assisted in nursing her on the difficult journey." <Universal> .

<BUY> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Mesmerism and Recovery HM was advised to try mesmeric treatment, the experimental therapeutic practice of the re-alignment of spirits which had been promoted by Franz Anton Mesmer as early as 1778, and which was popular in Britain throughout the period 1830-1860. She was initially held back by a strong family prejudice against it, though eventually her brother-in-law Thomas Greenhow counselled her to try it after submitting to a demonstration himself. 22 June 1844 HM was mesmerised for the first time; on pursuing the treatment, she was staggered to find that she eventually regained her health. The ministrations of renowned mesmerist Spencer T. Hall had no beneficial result, but her maid in copying his movements produced a strong sense of well-being that lasted for hours. Eventually a trained mesmerist acceptable to HM was found in a respectable woman, Mrs Montagu Wynyard, sent by Henry Atkinson. HM was also delighted to find apparent powers of clairvoyance in her landlady's nineteen-year-old niece, Jane Arrowsmith. Mrs Wynyard's name is variously spelled: thus by Webb but Mrs Montague Wynward by Roberts, Mrs Wynard by Wheatley." <Universal> .
<BUZ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "December 1854 HM began to experience heart palpitations and dizziness; London doctors found a large pear-shaped abdominal tumour pressing against her vital organs. She was convinced she was dying. This diagnosis suggests that her earlier tumour had simply shifted position, thereby making the mesmermic cure coincidental with the movement of the tumour. Although Martineau always defended mesmerism, she began to use opiates after this diagnosis. From this point on, her health deteriorated and she was largely an invalid in her home at Ambleside." <Universal> .

As she recorded in her Autobiography, however, she refused to meet those whom she felt to have insulted her beyond the bounds of propriety, namely John Gibson Lockhart (editor of the Quarterly Review ), John Sterling (editor of the Times ), and Thomas Moore. She was gratified to become friendly with and later visit Thomas Malthus, whose work she had done much through her writing to promote. Other good friends were the historian Henry Hallam (father of Arthur Henry Hallam ), Richard Monckton Milnes, writers Mary Russell Mitford, Harriet and George Grote, and Jane and Thomas Carlyle, to the latter of whom she attributed a great improvement in public morality over her lifetime. She knew the Kemble family, preferring Adelaide to Frances. She admired and liked Mary Somerville, deeming her, along with Joanna Baillie (whom she met at the home of Mary Berry ) and Elizabeth Barrett Browning (with whom she corresponded), one of a few really able women,\u2014women sanctified by true genius and holy science. These able women compensated for the vanity she saw in women such as Lady Morgan, Sarah Austin, and Anna Jameson. But she pointed out that the vanity displayed by men such as Lord Brougham and Edward Bulwer (whom she described as a woman of genius enclosed by misadventure in a man's form ) far outstripped that of women. Her autobiography is full of sharp commentary on these and many other contemporaries. Her most intimate friends included the families of Fanny and Hensleigh Wedgwood (the writer Julia Wedgwood's parents), Anne Marsh (whom she helped to get published), Elisabeth Jesser Reid, and Elizabeth Ker. She corresponded with many other women writers, including Maria Edgeworth, Fredrika Bremer, and Mary Ann Kelty." <Universal> .

She also visited Ralph Waldo Emerson (he returned the courtesy with a visit to Ambleside years later), who expressed his sympathy for the abolitionist cause. While in America she also had the curious experience of meeting a familiar-sounding parable being used by Bronson Alcott (father of Louisa May ) in his educational experiments, and by another Unitarian as the basis for a sermon, which she then identified as a story of her own from the The Monthly Repository. Another of her American friends was Nathaniel Hawthorne." <Universal> .

Although she recorded her dislike for his social egotism and misogynistic opinions, his hatred and fear of Russian despotism further fueled her existing dislike of it. Her wide social circle at this date included Gaskell, Carlyle, and Lady Harriet Baring., and Erasmus Alvey Darwin, too (brother of the famous Charles), was a friend.

Among those who visited her at Tynemouth for substantial periods were Elisabeth Jesser Reid and Emily Taylor, but the latter of these friendships was by then rapidly deteriorating.

Before they met in person he had given instructions through a third party that had guided her recovery by mesmerism. Their sustained exchange of philosophical ideas began in 1847.." <Universal> .
<CES> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "That year HM began a sustained correspondence with the Windermere divine the Rev. Perceval Graves, which lasted until 1867. Charlotte Bront\u00EB first met HM in person in December 1849, after pseudonymously contacting her by letter the month before. The ensuing friendship was marked by admiration and sympathy on both sides. December 1850 HM was visited by Charlotte Bront\u00EB at her home in Ambleside. She commented admiringly on HM's ability to combine the highest mental culture with the nicest discharge of feminine duties. In 1853 HM's frank review of Bront\u00EB's Villette, which she described in a Daily News review as intolerably painful, caused the relationship to founder. Martineau also remonstrated: There are substantial, heartfelt interests for women of all ages, and under ordinary circumstances, quite apart from love.. Though Bront\u00EB was wounded by what she saw as the misconceptions of the review, in letters she had kind words for the noble author, and said that she did not feel it would be right to give Miss Martineau up entirely. But, as Martineau writes, Bront\u00EB died before another book of hers could (as I had hoped it would) enable her to see what I meant and to re-establish a fuller sympathy between us. No reconciliation, therefore, was ever effected." <Universal> .

Her trip permitted her to observe first-hand the violent clashes over abolition then occurring in the streets of Boston, and it also brought her into contact with important figures in the US movement, who welcomed her, according to Ellis Gray Loring, as the writer of the best anti-slavery tale ever written, that is, Demerara. Although there was some personal danger involved, she publicly declared her sympathy with the US movement at a meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. She was vilified for her opinions in the press, and papers in the southern states published articles daring me to enter the Slave States again, and offering mock invitations to me to come and see how they would treat foreign incendiaries. They would hang me: they would cut my tongue out, and cast it on a dunghill; and so forth.

One of the founders of sociology, who believed that social affairs proceed according to great general laws, no less than natural phenomena, she produced several major contributions to this emerging field. She wrote broadly in periodicals and regularly for a newspaper on social and political issues, and produced three books of observations emerging from her foreign travels. Although her two three-volume novel s were not particularly successful, her work had a great impact on later Victorian fiction. She also wrote history, biography, and household manuals. Her advocacy of mesmerism and her atheism made some of her later writings controversial. In her eminently readable autobiography and other writings she presents a cogent analysis of conditions shaping the lives of Victorian women. Although she became hugely influential\u2014one of the most prominent women writers of her day\u2014 HM eschewed notions of genius.

She used this public approval as justification for the creation of the second manual." <Universal> .
<DJ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Mary Ann Evans, later George Eliot, read SSE's conduct manuals in the 1840s, but it is unlikely that Eliot took the advice too seriously, since other intellectual women were vocal in their distaste for such manuals. An article of 1846 by Anna Jameson (who influenced Eliot) condemned their idealized representation of Victorian women' roles. Caroline Frances Cornwallis did not pull her punches in writing to a young girl (one of SSE's target audience) on 2 April 1843 : I hate Mrs. Ellis's writings; they are jejune, ill-written, and ennuyeux \u00E0 faire mourir [to make you die of boredom]. I certainly do wonder with you how she could contrive to spin out so few ideas into such a lengthy article but I wonder still more that she should find anybody to read what she writes. I suppose people think that as all wholesome physic is nasty, so all that is very stupid and tiresome must be very good.\" Aside from such readers, however, SSE was enormously influential during the 1840s, and her philosophies shaped the anonymous advice columns found in periodicals such as The Ladies' Monthly Magazine. At least one critic argues that magazines such as this perpetuated in serial form the female advice book tradition to which Ellis is probably the single most important Victorian contributor. Literary historian Walter E. Houghton considered her works standard manuals promulgating the concept of separate gendered spheres, whereby the altruistic world of women\u2014associated with the spiritual\u2014serves as a refuge from and compensation for the selfish and competitive masculine world, which is materialist, and thus degrading. SSE's continuing renown as a writer was such that her nieces compiled and published as late as 1893 a collection of her letters, The Home Life and Letters of Mrs Ellis. SSE was viewed with ambivalence by a later generation of critics who sought to reclaim women's literature. Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, for example, read Ellis as a willing captive in a separate sphere, labelling her Victorian England's foremost perceptress of female morals and manners. Elaine Showalter, however, urges a more complex re-reading of Ellis like that seen in recent critical work by Karen Chase and Michael Levenson. Critic Kathy Alexis Psomiades develops a strong argument for understanding SSE's legacy as part of the very fabric of a gendered aesthetic that persists beyond Victorianism and continues to shape notions of culture." <Universal> .

Sarah's father, William Stickney, was a self-educated man with an interest in science. A tenant at Ridgmont, he worked to improve his farm by becoming an expert on agricultural affairs. He encouraged Sarah's early interest in animals. Around 1808 William Stickney re-married. With his second wife he had two daughters and two sons, and their half-sisters help[ed] greatly in their nursing and training. One of Sarah's sisters, Dorothy, married a man named Sewell, making Sarah a relation by marriage to the writers Mary Sewell and Anna Sewell." <Universal> .
<FP> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "William Ellis Sarah Stickney met her future husband by 1833 when he published some of her early writing; later he recruited her help in other publishing ventures. William Ellis, born into the labouring class, was a self-educated man of high attainments. He had worked as a foreign missionary with the London Missionary Society in Tahiti and Hawaii. In 1830 he was appointed the Society's chief foreign secretary, and five years later his first wife died. His son and three daughters became SSE's stepchildren; the second marriage was childless. William Stickney is best known for his involvement in the crisis over the persecution of converts and execution of missionaries which began in 1835 in Madagascar, and led him to travel there in the 1850s in an attempt to improve conditions. 23 May 1837 Sarah Stickney married author, missionary, and widower William Ellis at a small church in Burstwick in the East Riding of Yorkshire. William Ellis had published Polynesian Researches in 1829, which, with his History of Madagascar, 1838, constitute early attempts at ethnography. They were significantly influenced by his role as a missionary, which was in turn inflected by notions of British cultural superiority. Among his rather sensationally described topics were infanticide, polygamy, and the Hindu ritual of sati or suttee. Before her marriage, Sarah wrote to her future husband to warn him about her independence: [w]ith regard to asking for advice, I believe I did not state the case properly, for I often ask, but seldom take advice, and this you will find one of the lamentable consequences of marrying a middle-aged independent woman.... The kind of life I have led has tended very much to confirm a strength of will which, in my childhood, was, I believe, almost without equal. What will you do with such a companion? The tenor of this letter is surprising when compared to her published advice to wives. It has been remarked, however, that while her public life resembled the Victorian ideal of womanhood which her books disseminated... her letters reveal the discrepancy between prescription and practice. She was by no means the only female prescriber of submission and self-restriction to women who regarded herself as an exception to the rule." <Universal> .
<FQ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "1852 The London Missionary Society commissioned SSE's husband, William Ellis, to travel to Madagascar, where a campaign against British Christian missionaries was producing hundreds of grisly deaths. Willliam Ellis made a whole series of visits to Madagascar, the last one in May-June 1862, when he was sixty-seven. He engaged himself somewhat recklessly in local politics, and did scholarly investigation into local flora and languages. His first-hand written accounts of Madagascar brought him reputation and lecturing engagements." <Universal> .

One is too apt to feel on such occasions the pettied resentment that you might entertain against one who had poachd on your manor. He went on to develop the image, not of a poacher but of colonial settlers who have the right to exploit a territory first discovered by someone else.

So much must be softened before it can be even hinted at to general readers, that all usefulness or reason to dabble in mud fades away; whilst the mere fact that lies at the root of the life of outcast women, draped and made decent as it may be, is too dreadful to be anything but a pollution to the tale or poem that adopts it for a theme.

He came to terms with the author's sex in a somewhat tortured manner: Women might, and it was becoming they should, protect and comfort the poor; political economy has an immediate connection with this; therefore a woman may be a political economist without being supposed to have abated any natural and right horror of Amazons in politics. HM considered this review extraordinarily laudatory and appreciated its analysis, but she disagreed with it on several points relating to social morality. Overall she thought the praise did not seem... to be very rational and sound. She also claimed that the Edinburgh's reputation as an instrument of the Whigs meant that its positive review of her series was bad for sales, making readers assume (unwarrantedly, in her view) that she was a pet of the Liberal Party." <Universal> .

God has given a Prophet to every People in its own speech, say the Arabs.

<YK> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "More recently, critic Alexis Easley has argued that by providing readers with the tools to analyze other cultures\u2014and their own\u2014from a gender-sensitive perspective, HM fostered a feminist consciousness among middle-class readers, encouraging them to view gender roles as categories generated by a given set of institutional arrangements, rather than as natural, God-given identities. Resistance to this perspective within the emergent discipline may have been in part responsible for the disappearance of this should-be-classic from the annals of sociological history." <Universal> .
<YL> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Athen\u00E6um compared this novel favourably to the work of Jane Austen, saying that HM outstripped her predecessor in creating characters of a higher order of mental force and spiritual attainment, and offering to the middle classes pleasure which opens, elevates, and humanizes the mind. It judged the dialogue to be poor, however, and some characters over-idealised. The Edinburgh Review also compared Martineau to Austen, but was less positive. Considering the setting narrow, the events few, tame and trite, and the middle class most unromantic and unpicturesque, it warned HM not to expect popularity. The Blackwood's review led off with a highly critical assessment of her writings and her radical opinions, including what it understood as her claim to sexual equality, but it praised the novel strongly, saying she had approached Austen and produced an analysis of the affections worthy of Madame De Sta\u00EBl, with a picture of female purity and goodness far nobler and simpler than Corinne. This review pointed out with some glee what was regarded as flawed accounting in the representation of the Hope family's financial woe, but concluded by congratulating the author for resisting the prevailing fad for Byron ic heroes and offering a wholesome domestic tale of middle-class life." <Universal> .
<YM> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Athen\u00E6um was downright hostile to the book's subject: Do the negro justice, we say, by all means; but keep him, for half a century at least, out of our imaginative literature. This review found the book more accurate than most historical romances but felt that it fell short of success as fiction because the dialogue generally weak and the character and speech of the hero were unbelievable given his debased background as a slave." <Universal> .

She begged HM to devote herself to prayer and desist from spreading such accounts." <Universal> .
<YQ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "But others were more sympathetic. Elizabeth Barrett Browning argued to Mary Russell Mitford that to speak the truth as she apprehends it, at such a cost, & to bear the penalty so highheartedly, does strike me as worthy of Harriet Martineau, & of all our admirations. A cousin who was tempted by HM's account to experiment with mesmeric practice was cautioned by Charles Darwin that a tendency to deceive is characteristic of disordered females." <Universal> .
<YR> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "A shorter and more patronising review by George Croly in Blackwood's began by distinguishing HM from our horror... the professional tourist; the woman who runs abroad to forage for publication; reimports her baggage, bursting with a periodical gathering of nonsense; and with a freight of folly, at once empty as air and heavy as lead, discharges the whole at the heads of a suffering people. He dubs Martineau, however, lady-president of the gossip school, praising her descriptive ability highly but utterly dismissing her allegedly weak and misguided lucubrations on what she calls Bibliolatry. The charming but finally unsympathetic Fraser's review, Fuss in a Book-Club, charts, from the point of view of a copy of the book itself, its progress through a country book-club. Although read seriously and appreciated by some of its female readers, it is judged overall to be undermining Christian faith and is banished (as wicked Socinian trash ) to the study of a student in G\u00F6ttingen. The book-club replaces it with a copy of Agnes and Elizabeth Strickland's Lives of the Queens of England." <Universal> .

Inexplicably, the reviewer contended that this pure and noble woman required, after all, some man's arm to rest upon, if only for a moment's encouragement and support. This work, which provided the first substantial account of her life and writings, remains the major source on her." <Universal> .

<YY> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Valerie Kossew Pichanick wrote an account of HM's life and work in 1980, as did Gillian Thomas, 1985. Valerie Sanders's Reason Over Passion, 1986, was the first major study of her impact on Victorian fiction, and Deirdre David considered her relation to patriarchy a year later, stressing her ambiguous relationship to masculine authority and her self-construction as an intellectual daughter. Shelagh Hunter historicised HM's work as poetic moralism, looking at her texts in light of her life and the Autobiography, and Claudia Ora\u01FDem in 1999 examined the work on political economy. Deborah Anna Logan's The Hour and the Woman: Harriet Martineau's\"Somewhat Remarkable\" Life, 2002, aimed to restore HM to history as a literary grandmother and major voice of her day, with the most sustained investigation to date of her vexed relationship to feminism. Logan followed this with Harriet Martineau, Victorian Imperialism, and the Civilizing Mission, 2009, which argues Martineau's importance as a commentator on empire. Caroline Roberts's The Woman and the Hour: Harriet Martineau and Victorian Ideologies, 2002, is a historicised study of seven major texts in the context of their initial reception. In addition to this harvest of criticism, rising interest in HM has produced teaching editions of two of her texts\u2014 Life in the Sick-Room and Illustrations of Political Economy: Selected Tales (a sampling from the range of Illustrations )\u2014from Broadview Press." <Universal> .

<ZF> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Political Influence Because she reached a large audience on current issues such as political reform, industry, and economic policy, HM became highly influential in political circles. She was sent so many Blue Books ( Parliament ary reports) that her post had to be delivered in a wheelbarrow. Her opinion was solicited on details of legislation, including the New Poor Law (introduced on 14 August 1834 ), of which she was a proponent, and she was at times asked by the government to treat a particular subject earlier rather than later in order to address proposed legislation." <Universal> .
<ZG> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "HM formed links with the wing of the abolitionist movement led by William Lloyd Garrison, and made a fast friend in Maria Weston Chapman, a pivotal member of this movement. Long after her return to England, Martineau worked in concert with various individuals and anti-slavery societies in the USA, sometimes providing articles\u2014about ninety for the National Antislavery Standard under the initials H. M. \u2014and sometimes Berlin-wool embroidery to raise funds for the cause. (She kept up her needlework throughout her life, taking considerable pride in it and donating her productions for the most part to Abolitionist fundraising. Deborah Anna Logan, author of a recent biography, emphasizes how Martineau regarded this art as a substitute for the pen: when prolonged illness periodically compelled her to relinquish her role as a woman of the press [she relied] on the needle as her medium for activism. ) Like many women, HM connected abolition with the delivery from oppression of her own sex. She applauded Garrison for sitting in the gallery of the World Anti-Slavery Convention in June 1840 alongside the female delegates who had been excluded: It has done much for the woman question, I am persuaded. You will live to see a great enlargement of our scope, I trust. Her regard was returned. In 1856 Garrison and the American Anti-Slavery Society at Boston formally expressed appreciation for HM's great and holy life... unreservedly and strenuously devoted to the welfare of mankind. Martineau's link with the movement, including her participation in its internal struggles, continued throughout her lifetime. In this context she privately deplored what she saw as the sentimentality of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Abolition was not the only social cause in which Martineau interested herself during her visit to the USA. She was condemned by the American Quarterly for pollut[ing] her person and her trumpet by the breathings of the depraved of humanity in her visits to penitentiaries." <Universal> .
<ZH> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "In the same year HM made preparations to receive Aislie, a slave child from New Orleans described in Retrospect of Western Travel, whom HM intended to train as a maid and send to school, only to learn that the donor had no title to the girl, who had been reclaimed by his mother-in-law." <Universal> .
<ZI> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "She continued to support causes such as abolitionism and the Anti-Corn Law League, for which she undertook to write a tale in 1845. She did not have much sympathy for Italian unification (a cause taken up by many of her English acquaintances), to which she thought the people of Italy were indifferent." <Universal> .
<ZJ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Soon after establishing herself at Ambleside, in her second course of lectures there (presumably around 1849), HM instructed the working people in the principles of a Building Society, so that they would be enabled to improve their living conditions and own instead of renting homes. The meeting to form a society took place in her kitchen, and she helped to have the land surveyed and divided up. Elisabeth Jesser Reid was enlisted to loan the money to buy land. The financial details of the Building Society apparently contributed to a cooling of relations between the two women after 1855, as did their differences of opinion over US politics. She notes that this was done to preclude the form of tyranny exercised by the owners of land and houses, although this analysis did not enter into her lectures." <Universal> .
<ZK> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Political Broker HM represents herself in her Autobiography as brokering the successful repeal of the Corn Laws which took place on 26 June 1846, by mediating between Robert Peel and Richard Cobden. Histories of the repeal do not mention her, however, or touch on her only as a commentator, not as an actor. She also maintains that Irish nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell hoped in 1848 that she could be persuaded to devote twelve months or more to studying the social and political state of Ireland first-hand, as she had done with the United States, and provide a fair representation of the country's state. She was prevented by illness from undertaking this project, although she did later write on Ireland for the Westminster Review and in leaders for the Daily News which were then reprinted as Letters from Ireland." <Universal> .
<ZL> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "On Celibacy and Feminism HM revelled in her single state and proclaimed herself probably the happiest single woman in England. In keeping with the general interest among earlier Victorian feminists in the potential of sisterhoods, an article about monachism by Southey inspired her with the hope (reminiscent of Mary Astell at the end of the seventeenth century) to see the economy of association made use of by women; to see them living in a sort of club-house, enjoying comfort and luxury, rather then dispersed in poverty among boarding houses and schools. For all the influences that might have been expected to predispose Martineau to admire the work of Mary Wollstonecraft, she apparently despised the earlier writer as insufficiently self-sufficient. She called Wollstonecraft, with all her powers, a poor victim of passion, and one who, along with some prominent Victorian feminists, was harmful to Woman's cause... precisely in proportion to their personal reasons for unhappiness. HM came to be a legendary feminist figure, supporting many women's causes. She did not believe in the indissolubility of marriage vows, and she strongly supported female education and the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. Scholar Valerie Kossew Pichanick notes that Martineau was optimistic about the benefits that equality of opportunity would bring: she believed that the democratization and the industrialization of England would end sex-role discrimination. Pichanick also notes that because she accepted the fact of women's domestic responsibilities, one dilemma that Martineau was not able to resolve was how to balance the equality of female education with the additional burden of household duties. Believing that the laws of society would remove barriers in the long run, she eschewed personal complaint even though she considered her disqualification from voting an absurdity, seeing that I have for a long course of years influenced public affairs to an extent not professed or attempted by many men. But as critic Alexis Easley notes, she carefully avoided direct association with the feminist movement, preferring to campaign for women's rights as a behind-the-scenes journalist and power-broker." <Universal> .
<ZM> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Property HM's biographer R. K. Webb argues that her intellectual and political positions flowed quite logically from her family's business and religious interests: from a kind of radicalism typical of the industrial north. This gave rise to two fundamental convictions: her manufacturers' radical ism and a superbly adapted analogue, Priestley's optimistic necessarianism. In consequence, she was a liberal, in the literal sense of one concerned for freedom, a freedom both positive and negative, a goad and sanction to do right as well as an injunction to remove restraints. She trusted in the natural laws of society to ensure continuing progress against considerable obstacles. When she wrote her Autobiography in 1855, she predicted a long-drawn-out and intermittent European war which might outlast the century and would result in a discarding of the existing worn-out methods of government, and probably the establishment of society under a wholly new idea, crucial to which would be a deep modification in the institution of Property. Such modification she regarded as essential to social regeneration, believing the institution of absolute ownership of land as property to be outmoded: the old practice of Man holding Man as property is nearly exploded among civilised nations; and the analogous barbarism of Man holding the surface of the globe as property cannot long survive. The human sciences were at the root, in her view, of the social progress she anticipated. Contagious Diseases Acts When the Ladies' National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was formed in December 1869, HM's was one of the leading signatories. She also participated in the same campaign through articles in the Daily News. Abuse; Education By 29 May 1872 A petition by HM and 500 other women opposed a bill to institute flogging as a penalty for wife-beating and child abuse. The petition argued that while they recognised the insufficiency of existing punishments, this particular one was certain to increase the brutal, cruel, and revengeful spirit from which such crimes invariably spring. HM also donated to the campaign to achieve access for women to medical education in Edinburgh." <Universal> .
<ZN> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "27 June 1876 HM died in a coma, of a slow-growing ovarian tumour, at her home in Ambleside in the Lake District. A severe bout of bronchitis had weakened her: the tumour first detected over thirty-five years before, measuring twelve inches in diameter at the time of her death, had restricted her vital organs and made breathing increasingly difficult. In a final gesture, she willed her skull and brain to Henry Atkinson for phrenological examination, and she considered willing her ears to a doctor interested in deafness; but neither of these bequests was actually received. HM was buried, at her instructions very simply, at the family plot at Key Hill in Birmingham." <Universal> .
