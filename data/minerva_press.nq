<BAI> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "This novel was written at such an early age, said RMR, that some people thought it was really the work of her father. A review, perhaps by Wollstonecraft, in the Analytical Review advised the apparently very young author to throw aside her pen : we forebear to censure in a sarcastic style; yet we cannot agree with her that this work is unstudied; nay, we think that labouring to ornament it, she has rendered many passages unintelligible. The Critical Review placed it at the top of the second rank of novels: somewhat inexperienced but natural, easy, pleasing and interesting, and unhackneyed in the tricks of the profession. Languages, characters, situations, and moral all met with approval. Andrew Becket in the Monthly agreed, praising the author by name for plainness, simplicity, irreproachable sentiments, the ability to grip her reader, and, most importantly, some successes in character drawing." <Universal> .
<BAJ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The British Critic (in the only review received by The Children of the Abbey ) judged it to be entertaining and well-written. It felt the well-drawn character of Adela to be somewhat too romantic, but admitted that this might be a draw rather than a drawback for readers. At the end of the nineteenth century Eliza Lynn Linton, looking back with nostalgia and some irony, remember[ed] a day when (apparently now almost unimaginably) this novel and Mary Ann Kelty's The Favourite of Nature were satisfactory expositions of human life and character." <Universal> .
<BAK> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical Review was reminded unpleasantly of Ann Radcliffe (from whom, indeed, says Rictor Norton in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, passages are lifted without acknowledgement). The Critical summed up this novel as consisting of the usual apparatus of dungeons, long galleries, clanking chains and ghosts, and a profusion of picturesque description which, though it displays some merit, serves only to interrupt the narrative. Austen made fun of it in Northanger Abbey, but a recent critic, Tenille Nowak, has argued that she nonetheless discerned some value in it and included numerous veiled allusions to Clermont to test her readers' familiarity with popular literature. On these grounds Nowak argues that Austen intended to preserve Clermont from oblivion, and that indeed it deserves more critical respect than it has received." <Universal> .

Of equally dubious provenance are two collections of shorter fiction, London Tales; or, Reflective Portraits (anonymous) and Plain Tales (as by Mrs. Roche, author of\"The Moor\", &c., which appeared from different publishers in the same year, 1814. ( The Moor is untraced: it might be intended to recall Charlotte Dacre's sensational Zofloya; or, The Moor, 1806.)

<EG> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Little is known of HC's mother, who was born Elizabeth Stewart and who died in 1787. Her father, William Craik (1703-98), was a landowner and a progressive, experimental farmer (also a customs inspector and Justice of the Peace ) at Arbigland in Dumfriesshire. While Helen was a small child he designed and built a new mansion-house in classical style to reflect his power and status. It is still a tourist site. John Paul Jones, founder of the US navy, was the son of a gardener there, and his cottage birthplace on the estate is now a museum. Family legend said that William Craik had various illegitimate children and that Jones was one of them, but no evidence for this last statement is offered. HC's sister Ann or Anne, born about 1740, married John Hamilton and in 1762 had a son, Douglas Hamilton-Craik, whom her father later named as the family heir. Helen, who had loved her late brother Adam, despised her nephew Douglas. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography calls John Hamilton a distant relative of HC's father, but according to the International Genealogical Index he was William Craik's son-in-law. These family records were, however, submitted to the IGI by a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, not drawn directly from parish records. The name of Craik seems to have been the one that persisted in this family, for the autobiographer Eliza Fletcher, n\u00E9e Dawson, who was nearly twenty years younger than HC, had a school friend of excellent talents who later became Mrs Craik of Arbigland, and had children." <Universal> .

Love and courtship seem to be the only plot it could recognise. At a minor character condoning adultery, it became magisterial: Emma Parker, these are poisonous weeds from the French nursery; and we do not wish them to become indigenous on British ground. It found none of the characters sympathetic, and Parker's display of learning too prominent.

<LW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical Review, in a brief notice, faulted this novel for improbability but refused to blame anything so strictly and exemplarily moral. An anonymous full-page review quoted at the end of EP's The Intrigues of a Morning (which sounds suspiciously like a puff) extols The Errors of Education for natural, pathetic, and interesting scenes, pleasing and striking characters, and correct and elegant language, but most of all for good sense and liberal sentiments. It quotes at length an observation from one male character to another that a mother who dresses up her daughters and exhibits them at every place of fashionable amusement, renders them vulnerable to men who will make them into jilts and coquets, and is herself little better than a procuress." <Universal> .
<LX> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical called EP, in reviewing this novel, a writer of no inferior talents as well as the advocate of virtue. It felt that the characters were natural if not original, and the events generally interesting without being extravagant." <Universal> .
<LY> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical Review judged this a novel not one of the first order, or even of the second, and its characters too darkly tinted.

<LZ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "William Enfield wrote in the Monthly Review that this book must stand or fall by its moral merit. He found the first volume better than the second, and the language natural, but never elegant and sometimes careless." <Universal> .

<MA> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical Review found this one romantic but plausible, with well supported characters, virtuous sentiments, and situations extremely interesting to the tenderest feelings of the heart. William Enfield in the Monthly agreed with a good deal of this, though he denied the novel first-class status and found the beginning more original than the later stages." <Universal> .
<MB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical Review sounded somewhat divided in its judgement. It commended this work's general good sense and tendency, and found the incidents, in the first volume at any rate, probable, interesting, and affecting, and interspersed with a variety of excellent and judicious observations. Yet the review went on to complain of too many irrelevant episodes, too complete a concentration on love as subject, and that horror is crowded upon horror till our sympathy becomes exhausted, and we read of faintings, death, and madness, with perfect apathy. Enfield in the Monthly ruled out first-class status (as he had done more than once for EP ) and complained of disunity among the parts, yet thought the book had too much merit to be wholly overlooked, or to be consigned to oblivion by indiscriminate censure. Somewhat surprisingly, he found the characters and even their conversation lifelike." <Universal> .
<MC> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical Review judged that the modesty with which [Parsons] deprecates the severity of criticism demand and deserve our applause. It approved the style, too, though not the number of digressions, and enjoyed Eugenia's foolish, romantic, monastic notion of heroism. It also, however, repeated a former plea for greater unity or fewer digressions in EP's stories." <Universal> .

<MF> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical Review once again found that interest dropped off here after the first volume. James Bannister in the Monthly found the work laudably moral, and sufficiently impassioned to affect the heart and to engage the attention." <Universal> .

<MI> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The British Critic observed that if the very life of a Novel is incident, various and endless incident, then The Peasant of Ardenne Forest was a very lively Novel; for incidents, not a little wonderful, are crouded into almost every page. Its praise, however, was slanted; it hinted that the novel was perhaps not perfectly natural and probable." <Universal> .

The contacts resulting from this position were no doubt extremely useful to her (she published her first novel, by subscription, five years later), and it was work, she believed, that saved her sanity: Excess of Misery [i.e. poverty] I believe preserved my Senses and my life, for the existence of my family depended upon me.

It quotes at length an observation from one male character to another that a mother who dresses up her daughters and exhibits them at every place of fashionable amusement, renders them vulnerable to men who will make them into jilts and coquets, and is herself little better than a procuress. Profits from this book enabled EP to launch two of her children on careers: her eldest daughter as a teacher and her surviving son (aged thirteen) at sea. 28 June 1797 The New-York Weekly Magazine reprinted an excerpt from EP's The Errors of Education : Henry and Louisa.

The two plots were not sufficiently connected and the language had occasional vulgarisms. It conceded that the book was a page-turner, and unexceptionably moral. It was well enough known in its time to be one of the horrid novels adored by Isabella Thorpe, the worldly gothic-addict in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey. But Devendra P. Varma, editor of The Northanger Set of Jane Austen Horrid Novels for the Folio Society (1968), observed that until the modern Gothic revival pioneered by Michael Sadleir and Montague Summers many readers supposed that Isabella's favourite titles might have been invented by Austen. Diane Long Hoeveler argues that this novel deserves to be more than a footnote to literary history." <Universal> .

It also, however, repeated a former plea for greater unity or fewer digressions in EP's stories. Devendra P.

Varma has noted the episodic or disjointed nature of many of her plots; Michael Sadleir accused her of coldly violent scenes of almost sadistic cruelty and of conjuring up ghosts only to explain them away as manifestations of something meaningless and trivial. In fact such zestfully reported cruelty, crimes, secrets, and mysteries about identity, were all accepted elements in the terror style of gothic. Nigel Cross is equally dismissive of Parsons in The Common Writer, 1985. Jennie Batchelor in work book argues that Cross ( despite flashes of quality... hastily written, trivial, and cynically tailored to an undiscriminating public) and Varma draw their damning terms directly from the self-presentation of Parsons and other poverty-stricken novelists to the Royal Literary Fund, which in turn was driven by conformity to contemporary notions of male genius and female hack writing." <Universal> .

Her next child, Mary, was baptised in Plymouth on 30 April 1762, and a son, William, on 13 February 1765. In all she had eight children, five daughters and three sons. All of the sons entered the army or navy, but they and one of the daughters all died by 1804.

<QB> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "18 December 1792 EP applied for help to the recently founded Literary Fund (later the Royal Literary Fund), detailing the various financial accidents and reverses that had so far befallen her. Reverses continued. By summer 1796 her salary from her court appointment was seven quarters in arrears: that is, she had received not much more than half the money owed to her since she took the position. Her poverty kept her constantly on the move from one cheap lodging to another. While she was incapacitated by her accident she spent all the money she had saved, and contracted some small debts. As before, her remedy was writing. Publishing two more novels brought her debts down to seventeen pounds (as well as launching several of her children on their careers), but then an unexpected call for twelve pounds (a risibly small sum compared with the fortunes enjoyed or needed by heroines of novels) threatened her with the prospect of debtors' prison, the horror of which must be the final destruction of myself and family. Attempting to get up a subscription which would make her next novel a more lucrative prospect, she confronted, like many middle-class women in financial difficulty, the fact that their claim to respect would be judged on their clothes. She wrote: I have long struggled with a thousand difficulties to preserve a decent Appearance, knowing that in this world of prejudices the Garb & Supplications of poverty generally excite Contempt or Cold Useless pity. Though the Royal Literary Fund treated her with relative generosity, she had, before her final application in May 1803, suffered arrest and imprisonment for debt. 6 September 1804 EP (who had once already gone to prison for debt) was up before a magistrate at the Surrey Sessions, charged with obtaining goods under false pretences and tax evasion. Though this sounds like a serious offence it may have been largely technical: The Times reported that she got off by changing her tax schedule.

<ZV> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "A review, perhaps by Wollstonecraft, in the Analytical Review advised the apparently very young author to throw aside her pen : we forebear to censure in a sarcastic style; yet we cannot agree with her that this work is unstudied; nay, we think that labouring to ornament it, she has rendered many passages unintelligible. The Critical Review placed it at the top of the second rank of novels: somewhat inexperienced but natural, easy, pleasing and interesting, and unhackneyed in the tricks of the profession. Languages, characters, situations, and moral all met with approval. Andrew Becket in the Monthly agreed, praising the author by name for plainness, simplicity, irreproachable sentiments, the ability to grip her reader, and, most importantly, some successes in character drawing." <Universal> .
<ZW> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical Review thought that this novel, if possibly amusing, was definitely forgettable. William Enfield in the Monthly found it natural, amusing, and romantic: the work was above contempt even though it had nothing to teach its readers and was, by implication, circulating-library material." <Universal> .
<ZX> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The British Critic (in the only review received by The Children of the Abbey ) judged it to be entertaining and well-written. It felt the well-drawn character of Adela to be somewhat too romantic, but admitted that this might be a draw rather than a drawback for readers." <Universal> .
<ZY> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "The Critical Review was reminded unpleasantly of Ann Radcliffe (from whom, indeed, says Rictor Norton in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, passages are lifted without acknowledgement). The Critical summed up this novel as consisting of the usual apparatus of dungeons, long galleries, clanking chains and ghosts, and a profusion of picturesque description which, though it displays some merit, serves only to interrupt the narrative." <Universal> .
<ZZ> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "RMR suffered from long illnesses and recurring depression." <Universal> .
